         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat the wiſe obſerving King uttered long agoe, <hi>that of making of Books there is no end,</hi> was never more veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in any then it is in the preſent age, wherein, <hi>ſcribunt docti indoctique,</hi> every ſmatterer and every fancie-full head muſt have the Preſſe travel to bring forth their froathy conceptions: And Preſſes by many are made uſe of as engines to diſcharge revylings, reproaches, and blaſphemies againſt the God of Heaven, his bleſſed Truths, wayes and Ordinances. For my ſelf, I can ſay in truth, it hath not hitherto been my ambition to increaſe wearineſſe of the fleſh by much Reading: And that now I come this way to the worlds view, 'tis not of mine own meer choiſe, but becauſe a neceſſity was laid upon me. The Author with whom I have to do in this enſueing debate, having not only opened his mouth to Preach in the
<pb facs="tcp:106774:3"/> most eminent-place in this Land, but alſo adventured to Write and Print againſt the Orthodox Doctrine touching the conſtitution and Government of the Viſible Church of Chriſt, revileing in ſpeciall the Church in this Land (yet through its ſide alſo ſtricking at all the Orthodox Churches in Europe) as no Church, but a dead carcaſſe having neither matter nor form of a true Church; a neſt of unclean birds, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thereupon charging with a great deal of confidence and big words, all truely Godly to come out of it and to ſeparate from it. It was by ſome Reverend and Godly men thought expedient, that (altho there appear little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in what is ſaid by him, which may brangle the mind of any judicious Reader: Yet becauſe it is a thing uſuall to adverſaries of the Truth, if what they ſay, be it never ſo weak, get not an Anſwer, to brag of it as unanſwerable; And unſettled minds that have not their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern good and evill, are ready to be taken with any thing busked up with gay words, and ſo to be carried about, like weather-Cocks with every wind of Doctrine, as many ſad examples of this time prove,) an Anſwer ſhould be returned to him, leſt truth ſhould ſo much as ſeem to ſuffer prejudice any way. And this taske they were pleaſed to lay upon me. Who albeit I do, and cannot but ingenuouſly acknowledge my ſelf one of the leaſt and weakeſt Servants of Chriſt, and that many others there are in this Church, who might far more worthily acquit themſelves in this ſervice: Yet durſt not withſtand the motion, having ſo clear a Calling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering withall how I ſtand oblidged, in my ſtation, to maintain the true Religion, in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, by the mercy of God eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, in common with the reſt of the Lords people in the Land, by Solemn Vow and Covenant, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb facs="tcp:106774:3"/> by the Lords bringing me, who had been in my young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er years educated, as to many things, in a contrary way, to the acknowledgment of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he truth, in a very gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with a ſtrong hand, and in much long-ſuffering patience, whereby he waited to be gracious, that he might be exalted in ſhewing mercy on me.</p>
            <p>Haply it will be matter of talking to ſome, that this of mine has been ſo long in coming forth after <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Lockier</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his. But it is not unknown to many who have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to my diligence, that my Anſwer was in readineſſe within a few Moneths after his Peece came to my hands, and the task was laid upon me. And had come abroad if ſeveral difficulties had not interveened,</p>
            <p>Now when it is to be publiſhed, I deſire humbly to preſent it to your Lordſhip firſt, and under your Honourable name to the view of the world. I muſt ſpare to expreſſe all the great cauſes oblidging me ſo to do: Becauſe to expreſſe them would not only be, haply inexpedient; But alſo would be, I know, unſavoury to your ſelf, whom I have alwayes found deſirous to aprove your ſelf in reality of wel doing, but never liking well to hear of other mens <hi>euges.</hi> Only this much I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear and muſt begge your Lordſhips leave to ſay. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall obligations which you have laid upon me by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tract of undeſerved reſpects, ever ſince the firſt time I was known to your Lordſhip, would require a worthier teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of acknowledgment, then is this mean preſent, or any thing elſe my ſmall ſtore of abilities can afford. But to ſpeak truth, it is not ſo much any perſonall concernment that hath engaged my heart to your Lordſhip, as that which hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared you to all who know the truth and you: That grace which God hath vouchſafed upon you to walk in tenderneſſe and cloſeneſſe with himſelf in your privat courſe and with
<pb facs="tcp:106774:4"/> conſtant zeal to improve your publick ſtation wherein ye have ſtood, for promoving the intereſt of Religion and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and the good of Gods people without byaſſe or wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in any revolution of times (wherewith many turning upon the axletree of their own ſelf-intereſts, have whirled about) the ſweet fruit whereof, I doubt not but you find in theſe glowmie dayes, and truſt ſhall abide with you to the end, through the mercy of the Lord whoſe gifts and graces are without repentance.</p>
            <p>I will not adventure upon ſuch ſevere ſelf-denyedneſſe to ſpeak more of what I have had the happineſſe to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, in your Lordſhip. I hope this teſtimony of my ſenſe of the obligation I ly under to honour your Lordſhip ſhal finde favourable acceptance at your hands. <hi>I</hi> will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume (for indeed it were preſumption) to commend my work in it: I pretend to nothing therein, but that, through the Grace of God, I have ingenuouſly and in ſimplicity, tho in much weakneſſe, ſpoken for truth: But the matter it ſelf is precious and of great weight, conſiſting of two great intereſts of Chriſt Jeſus his Viſible Church, which is his Viſible Kingdom on earth. The one touching the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the perſons that are to be acknowledged members of his Viſible Church, and ſo, in effect, comes to be a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>de ſinibus,</hi> of the marches of his Viſible Kingdom: The other touching the matter and way of the externall Viſible Government thereof.</p>
            <p>As to the former, my Author has ſo ſtraitned the bounds of Chriſts Viſible Church, that by his ſentence none are to be acknowledged as members thereof, and conſequently to be under the Miniſteriall diſpenſation of the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, the ordinary means of ſaving ſouls, but ſuch as are already and antecedently found to be ſavingly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:106774:4"/> regenerated and ſealed of God for his by the Holy Spirit, if not in the truth of the object (which yet moſt part of his reaſoning and diſcourſe pleads for) yet in the poſitive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of very ſpirituall and diſcerning men: And that as ſome others of his way further lay out the matter, upon triall and proof thereof given, by a converſation led without the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any known duty, or commiſſion of any known ſin: A publick declaration of their knowledge in the fundamentalls and of other points of Religion neceſſary to lead a life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcandall, together with a narration of the experimentall work of their Effectuall Calling unto Repentance and faith: And all Churches that are not conſtituted of only ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as this, are, to our Author, wrong conſtitute. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this Examination, my labour is to diſcover the unwarrantablneſſe and contrariety of this Tenent, to the Word of God; And to ſhew that all who being of years does ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly profeſſe the Chriſtian faith, and ſubjection to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd and governed by the Ordinances of Chriſt, ought to be admitted into the fellowſhip of his Viſible Church, without any neceſſity of puting them to a triall touching their inward ſpirituall eſtate, and judging upon the ſame whether regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat or not, as to that effect: And are to be dealt with, by Paſtours and privat Chriſtians in their reſpective wayes as theſe that are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> within, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. Upon this point I have inſiſted the more largely, becauſe not ſo fully and of purpoſe handled by others before. And it is, of a truth, of greater importance then many are awarre of. 'Tis far from my thoughts to charge our Independent Brethren with any perverſe deſigne in taking up and following that opinion which I diſpute againſt. Many of them, known to me by their writings, eſpecially theſe worthy Miniſters in <hi>New-England, Cotton, Hooker, Shepheard, Norton,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:106774:5"/> I do from my heart reverence as godly and faithfull Servants of Chriſt, and as burning and ſhining lights in the Reformed Church: But I think verily, the ſpecious notion of a pure Viſible Church has duzled their eyes, and led them upon a way which in it ſelf, beſide that it hath no warrand in the Word of God, ſhould it get footing in the world, tends to the ruine &amp; loſs of many ſouls, and to the bringing of the greateſt prejudice to the preſent Cauſe and Churches, that any thing ever yet did ſince the firſt Reformation from Popery: And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that, albeit the intention of thoſe holy and reverend men abettors of it, be honeſt and from ſimplicity of heart; Yet Satan is under-board (let no man offend at this I ſay, <hi>Peters</hi> example teacheth us, that Satan may abuſe good mens zeal and intentions for Chriſt to wicked ends, contrair to his Cauſe) Satan, I ſay, is under-board driving that wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. For if that be the the rule and modell of conſtituting the Viſible Church, which they give us, are not all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches by this means condemned of wrong conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp; razed out of the account of true Viſible Churches, as not being conformed, nor ever having been ſet up according to that modell? And what could more gratifie the <hi>Roman</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and his followers then to yeeld this? Again, is there not hereby a ground laid to Queſtion all Adminiſtration of Ordinances that has been in them, and to juſtifie the wilde fancy of Seekers, denying that there is, or hath been for many ages any Church or Ordinances in the world? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when as none of the Reformed Churches at this day are thus conſtitute, if that modell ſhould have place, muſt not either all of them be diſſolved and caſt down to the ground, that new ones may be reared up of ſome few precious ones picked out of their ruines, or to the effect they may conſiſt only of perſons regenerated and ſealed by the Spirit, all other
<pb facs="tcp:106774:5"/> perſons who, albeit they profeſſe the truth, ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Ordinances, yet come not up ſo far as to obtain a poſitive ſentence, that they are regenerat, upon ſuch <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

That this is no needleſſe fear, but a reall conſequent of this way, is too too clear, by the ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many in theſe times, who living without the pale of true Viſible Churches and not ſubject to the ſhepheards ſtaffe and vigilancy, are run out into ſo many wilde errours in Religion as never age of the Chriſtian Church ſaw the like. Touching the other head, the Author in his Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix pleadeth for two things. 1. That the power and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Church Government, ſhould be in the hands of the whole body, or community of Profeſſours as well as of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers appointed by Chriſt in the Church. A Tenent not heard of in the Chriſtian Church, untill <hi>Morellius</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> Anabaptiſts, and Browniſts fancied it, and, as contrary to the Word of God (which to Miniſters and other Officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt in his Church as contradiſtinguiſhed from common Profeſſours, attributeth the name of Rulers, injoyns the work of Ruling, and preſcribes the rules of right gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but never to the people) ſo cannot but unavoidably draw after it much confuſion and frequent ſchiſms in the Church of God, whereof experience affordeth plenty of examples. 2. That this power of Government ſhould be ſolely, intirely, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Independently in a ſingle Congregation. A Tenent
<pb facs="tcp:106774:6"/> that beſides the contrariety thereof to the Word of God and the very light of nature, carrieth with it a multitude of groſs abſurdities and inconveniencies. By this means let a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation of 30. or 20. or fewer, 10. or 7. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (for of ſo few may a Church, as our Brethren ſay, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly conſtitute) run into never ſo groſſe an errour, as to Excommunicate a perſon unjuſtly, to hold and maintain He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in Doctrine, to ſet up idolatrous worſhip, there is no Eccleſiaſtick authoritative remedy left under Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it: All Church-communion amongſt the Churches of Chriſt is taken away: The unity of Chriſts ſheep-fold, the Viſible Church upon earth is diſſolved, and Chriſt ſhould have as many viſible bodies as there are particular Congregations: A Miniſter could not perform any Miniſteriall act out of his own Congregation: Not Preach but as a privat gifted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Not Adminiſter the Sacraments out of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, nor give the Sacrament to a member of another Congregation (as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker</hi> ingenuouſly acknowledges, <hi>Surv. Part.</hi> 2.) admiſſion and ejection of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould only be into, and from a particular Congregation: A child ſhould be Baptized into a particular Congregation only, and not into the Univerſall Church: And one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, caſt out only of a particular Congregation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the power extends no further: Way is made to let in all errours and hereſies, and as many Religions as there are particular Congregations, and none can hinder it in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick way, and many more abſurdities ſhould follow, as Learned and Godly men have judiciouſly obſerved. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair to thoſe Aſſertions, is my ſecond Part imployed for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the true way of Government which Chriſt has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in his Word, and in great mercy ſet up in this Church, to wit, by his Miniſters and Officers, not Lording over the
<pb facs="tcp:106774:6"/> people of God in a Papall or Prelaticall way (as this Author either miſtakes or calumniats) but Miniſterially under Chriſt the only Lord of his Church, Ruling them according to the Rule of his Word, in a way of rationall obedience: And that in a way of communion and aſſociation of Churches, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of leſſer aſſociations unto greater and larger, as the Lord grants by his providence conveniency. On this I have not inſiſted ſo largly as the matter it ſelf might affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded occaſion of diſcourſe. Becauſe it has been by learned and reverend men already ſo fully debated, the proofs of the truth ſo clearly made out, and all contrary Objections ſo abundantly diſcuſſed and ſatisfied, that I had little or nothing to adde: Yet I truſt I have through the Lords help, in ſome meaſure, diſcovered the inſufficiency and invalidity of what is brought by this Author, who, I wonder much ſhould have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to preſent the world with ſuch a diſcourſe upon the mater after ſo learned labours of others, as are extant upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>I have alſo in two Appendices taken into conſideration what is ſaid upon theſe ſame points by ſome in <hi>Aberdene</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned aſide from the truth, in a Letter of theirs directed to ſome Godly men in the South, <hi>May</hi> 1652. The reaſons moving me hereto were 1. Becauſe of their correſpondence with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Lockiers</hi> Peece, and it ſeemeth they have been in a manner his proſelytes. Then having ſome time had more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and intimat acquaintance with ſome of them, it would be to me mater of much rejoicing in the Lord, if I could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall to diſcover to them the we kneſſe of the grounds whereupon they have fallen from their ſtedfaſtneſſe, that ſo, if poſſible, which I wiſh from my heart, they might be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to remember whence they have fallen, to repent and to do their firſt works: And finally t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> what ever ſhould be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to them, the irrelevancy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:106774:7"/> being laid open, others might ſee no cauſe why any ſhould be ſhaken with their fall. And bleſſed be God there are not yet many in this Land, that have followed them in this. What may be afterward, the Lord who ſees the thoughts of mens hearts afar off knoweth. Times indeed are ſifting: And the ignorance of many, the baſe earthly time ſerving minds of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, unadviſed principles in ſome, who, may be ſees not yet the far end of their conſequences, may prove an advantage to ſeducements &amp; produce more defection from the profeſſion of the truth, if temptations continue, then as yet we have ſeen. But let temptations and trialls be what they will, the Cauſe of Chriſt, even that part of it which I ſtand for here, the order &amp; Government of this Church, which he has appointed in his Word, and thereby made known to this Church, ſhal ſtand firm. It has been a cup of trembling to all that have hitherto laid ſiege againſt it, and a burdenſome ſtone to all that have at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time burdened themſelves w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And turn their back upon it who will, Chriſt will not want his witneſſes to bear witneſs unto it; Even if need be, by not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their lives unto the death. And O but that man might count himſelf highly favoured of God, whom he ſhould honour with that dignity! as that eminent ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Mr. Welſch</hi> ſpoke in relation to himſelf of ſuffering for ſome branches of the ſame cauſe, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sure, a man that would in Preaching hold forth to the People of God Doctrine as truth and received from the Lords mouth, and would convince people that it is ſuch, had need be ſure that the Scripture he preſents for it, doth indeed carry it, either expreſly, or by neceſſary and evident conſequence.

[And being brought on by the Church] what the matter of this Church is, read the next words and they will tell you,—they declared the converſion of the Gentiles, pag.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>begin. Anſ.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt here intendeth as the principall purpoſe, to deſcribe a viſible. Church of the New Teſt. by the proper conſtituent matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is but the meer conceit of the Author forced upon the Text,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106774:10"/> and no wayes deduceable from the words themſelves; the genuine purpoſe of the words being ſimply to note ſome circumſtances of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and the other Commiſſioners joyned with them, their journey from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whether they were ſent for reſolution upon the Queſtion then in controverſie at <hi>Antioch.</hi> As 1. The Chriſtian courteous reſpect that the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> put upon them, <hi>they were brought on their way.</hi> 2. What theſe commiſſioners did as they were on their journey: that they declared to the Chriſtians that lay in their way, that ſame thing that they had declared before at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Chap. 14. v. 27. viz. that God had been mightily with the Preaching of the Goſpel even amongſt the Gentiles, ſo that many of them (as the Story rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the particular countries and places, Chap. 13, and 14.) were converted to the Chriſtian Religion. 3. What effect this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced amongſt the Chriſtians to whom it was declared: that <hi>they had great joy</hi> at theſe tydings, that the Kingdome of Chriſt was ſo ſpreading, and that even the Gentiles were brought in to it. Here indeed are grounds of uſefull points of Doctrine: but what is all to that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> intends, the deſcription of a viſible Church by its proper matter? A Church viſible to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> is a particular Congregation participating together the Ordinances of Chriſt. Doth it any wayes appear that the Spirits intention in theſe words, is to deſcribe unto us what ſort of perſons were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the conſtitution of ſuch a Congregation? viz. as he would have it, not any profeſſours whoſoever, but ſuch only as were tryed and found, by truely converted, and very ſpiritual men, able to diſcern and judge, to be truely regenerate. What evidence is brought to ſhew that this is intended in the Text? This, to wit, that firſt it is ſaid, <hi>being brought on by the Church,</hi> and then, ſayes he, <hi>what the matter of this Church is, the next words tells, they declared the converſion of the Gentiles. Anſwer.</hi> What? muſt theſe latter words be a deſcription of that thing which is mentioned in the firſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church, viz. of <hi>Antioch</hi> (for that is the Church ſpoken of there) becauſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, the one followeth immediately after the other in the ſeries of the narration?

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106774:11"/> did conſiſt of ſuch as are here mentioned, <hi>i. e.</hi> converted Gentiles: but my purpoſe is to ſhew how impertinently the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath choſen and made uſe of this Scripture to be his Text for his Doctrine concerning the matter of a viſible Church.</p>

Therefore it is but a forcing of the Text, to make up of theſe two this Doctrine as intended in the words <hi>[A viſible Church conſiſts of converted ones as its proper matter]</hi> what ever truth may be in it of it ſelf. This, I ſaid before, I am not queſtioning now: but would diſcover the inconſideratnes of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and making uſe of this Text for that purpoſe, and adds but this: ſeeing in preaching the Word of GOD aright, any enunciative Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is propounded from a Text, if it ly not in the Text, in expreſſe and formall, or equivalent terms, yet ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable by good conſequence from it: I humbly deſire that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> would build a clear Syllogiſme upon any enunciation in this Text, inferring this Concluſion, <hi>[the proper matter of a viſible Church is converted ones]</hi> for in this Text it is not ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and immediatly, as he would ſeem to ſay in the next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in theſe words: <hi>The complexion of a viſible Church under the Goſpel is here ſaid to be converſion: the conſtituting matter, converted ones.</hi> This much might ſuffice for anſwer to this Text,

Yet we ſhall be at the pains to take into conſideration what followeth in the opening up of the Text, leſt we ſeem purpoſely to paſſe over any thing which may be alledged to ſpeak for the point maintained by the Author. I confeſſe it had been fitter that the controverſie had been firſt ſtated: but I am reſolved to follow the tract of Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> diſcourſe, that I may ſhunne the ſmalleſt appearance of wronging him.

This had been contrary to truth; for ſome of the converted Heathens, no doubt, had no more but the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, the preaching of the Goſpel being as a draw net that catches good fiſhes and bad together, and the outward Kingdom of GOD, as a field wherein are tares and wheat growing together. Nor yet can it be ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in that declaration meant, that all and every one of theſe Gentiles they ſpake of, were ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> true heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converts to their poſitive judgement, and ſo far as men truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106774:12"/> and very ſpirituall were able to diſcern. This appears not out of the words of the Text: for firſt, I think the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Converſion as including gracious heart-converſion, in the <hi>verity</hi> of the thing or <hi>Object:</hi> and not only in the <hi>charitative judgement</hi> of diſcerning men; tho not <hi>reſtrictively.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockiers</hi> addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>According to what a Chriſtian can diſcern of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or in ſo far as men,</hi> &amp;c.] is his own and not the Texts; yea I conceive 'tis contrary to the intention of the Text: becauſe I no wayes doubt but the Apoſtles meant poſitively that there was amongſt theſe Gentiles heart-converſion in the <hi>verity of the thing.</hi> But that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſayes by his additament may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorily oppoſite to that: men may be accounted heart-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in the charitable judgement of very diſcerning Chriſtians, and yet not be heart-converts indeed. 2. Granting that to be the meaning which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſaith to be, in his additament; yet can any thing be alledged from the words, that will import, it muſt be underſtood <hi>univerſaliter de omnibus &amp; ſingulis, i. e.</hi> univerſally of all and every one of theſe Gentiles: and may not be underſtood as ſpoken only <hi>de multitudine communiter &amp; indefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it cannot be demonſtrate out of the Text, that all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and were converted in this ſenſe. 3 By the grace of God, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> is ſaid to have ſeen, is meant the effectuall working thereof in bringing ſo many to imbrace the Doctrine of the Goſpel; as alſo, I make no doubt, captivating hearts to the obedience of it: but whether all and every one of their hearts, is not ſaid.

Barnabas is here ſaid to be a man full of the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore able to taſte his communion,—and he and Paul together, might be competently able to give a judgement what they found amongſt theſe firſt Chriſtians; and I think 'tis very dangerous to ſay, that as far as they could apprehend, theſe firſt Chriſtians had not both name and thing, for which commended, and in which by theſe worthies joyed in, pag.</hi> 5. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is, I may ſay, much ſand without lyme. 1. The Gentiles of whoſe Converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 3. ſpeaks, were of many more places beſides <hi>Antioch.</hi> Now ſuppoſe all here alledged were granted; what evidence can Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> give us, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or any ſuch other perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petentlie able to judge, had ſtayed as long in every one of theſe other places? 2. But to hold our ſelves to this Church of <hi>Antioch:</hi> I confeſſe indeed it were dangerous univerſally to ſay, that theſe firſt Chriſtians at <hi>Antioch</hi> had not (I ſay not only, as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> hath it, <hi>as far as able men could apprehend,</hi> but) in very deed, both name and thing, <hi>i. e.</hi> gracious heart-Chriſtianity: But I ſee it not ſo very dangerous to ſay that not <hi>all and every one</hi> of them had ſo much. Nay, I think it very dangerous poſitively to ſay they had: for 'tis clearly contrary to what the Scripture ſpeaketh of the effect and ſucceſſe of the Preaching of the Goſpel. and to many paſſages of this very Story of the <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. True, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were diſcerning men, able to give a good judgement in ſo much time, what they found amongſt thoſe Chriſtians. But what evidence can the Author give us from the Text, that this was their intended work during that ſpace, to examine and try what heart was in every one of theſe Profeſſours, and that in relation to conſtituting them a Viſible Church after that tryall, and judgment paſſed thereupon? The only work we find mentioned in the Text, ver. 26. is their teaching, <hi>they taught much people.</hi> And there is nothing in it ſo much as hinting at this, that they were not in ſtate of a Viſible Church, untill, after that whole years tryall, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had given judgement what they did find amongſt

But to the purpoſe in hand: true, able men in a long tract of time, having converſed with every particular member of a Church, may be able to give a good judgement of them: but the matter in queſtion is, <hi>in theſi,</hi> whether ſuch a judgement grounded upon a tryall of ſo long a time, muſt be antecedent to their ſtateing in Church-memberſhip. And in the <hi>hypotheſis</hi> of the particular now in hand, whether <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> had ſo long a time intimat communion with the <hi>Antiochian</hi> profeſſors, and thereby gave a judgement upon them concerning their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eſtate, before they were conſtitute in a Viſible Church.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106774:15"/> that before the time of this abode at <hi>Antioch,</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 28. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> after the work of the Goſpel begun at <hi>Antioch,</hi> had come thither ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> he and <hi>Paul</hi> had Preached there together a whole year, they had gone in commiſſion ſent by the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Chriſtians, with a relief to the diſtreſſed Brethren at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Chap. 11. and had returned again, Chap. 12. 25. And having ſtayed there ſome time, by ſpeciall Divine appointment they are ſent abroad through the Nations about to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: and having after a long peregrination returned again to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> then is ſaid that Chap. 14. 28. <hi>and there they abode a long time with the Diſciples.</hi> Now were not the <hi>Antiochians</hi> ſtated in a Viſible Church, untill judgement was given upon them after intimat communion in this time of abode? I might bring a multitude of Arguments to prove the contrary from ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Story going before: But I need go no further then the immediat preceeding Verſe, v. 27. <hi>When they were come and had gathered the Church.</hi> But it may haply be ſaid that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor brings this Paſſage to ſhew, not what tryall and knowledge <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had of them before they were ſtated Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in a Church Viſible; but what they might had of them to be a warrantable ground of their report made touching them, Chap. 15. 3.

If ſo, then ſay I he alledges it to no purpoſe as to his ſcope in this Lecture: for his intention is to have <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> Chap. 15. 3. ſpeaking of the qualification of theſe Gentiles in relation to their ſtating in a Viſible Church, and accordingly thereupon to build a generall Doctrine touching the proper matter of a Viſible Church.</p>

The Argument is clear and undenyable. GOD the Searcher of hearts hath born witneſſe to the Gentiles by giving to them the Holy Ghoſt, as well as to the Circumciſed Jews, and without putting difference, purifying their hearts through faith in JESUS CHRIST Preached by the Goſpel alone, without Circumciſion and other Ceremoniall Performances. Therefore it is his will, that Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bee not impoſed upon them, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary to Juſtification and Salvation. This is the plaine and ſole intention and drift of that Paſſage of Scripture. But ſure I am 'tis to little or no purpoſe, for Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> purpoſe: For howſoever it be true that 'tis clear from this Text, that there was a work of effectuall ſaving grace amongſt theſe Gentiles ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and I do agree with him this far; that it were dangerous, yea moſt clearly falſe and contradictory to the words of the Text, to affirm that theſe expreſſions might not mean effectuall ſaving grace; yet I ſay firſt, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was not here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this work of ſaving grace, as the neceſſary qualification for conſtituting perſons capable of Viſible Church-memberſhip. 2. Albeit, in theſe expreſſions ſpoken of the Gentiles, there be not <hi>definitely</hi> a reſtriction to <hi>ſome only</hi> (as M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nay, I know he'll ſalve the matter with his qualification, <hi>according to what Chriſtian can diſcern of Chriſtian, and ſo far as men,</hi> &amp;c. But 1. This is an addition to the Text, whereof there is not the leaſt inſinuation in the Text. 2. Yea, the Text ſpeaks clearly of ſuch a purifying of hearts, as is <hi>in veritate rei, ſeu objecti, i. e.</hi> indeed: becauſe it ſpeaks of it in relation to the knowledge and Judgement of GOD the ſearcher of hearts, whoſe Judgement is alwayes according to Truth.

For 1 I had ever thought it the received Doctrine of all Orthodox Reformed Divines, that the Churches of the Old and of the New Teſt are of one and the ſame nature, as to eſſentials; and that the difference between them ſtandeth in accidentals only. 2. Why do many of his way-bring Arguments for this his Tenet, touching the allowed matter of a Viſible Church, from Paſſages of the Old Teſt. ſpoken in relation to the then Church? 3. If the Viſible Church in the dayes of the Old Teſt. might have conſiſted of others, as allowed matter, then are deſcribed here (which his reſtriction inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>perſons not truly converted,</hi> &amp;c. then, to borrow his Arguments brought afterward. 1. Either Chriſt was not the Rock and foundation of that Church, and that Church not a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being and bearing upon him, as a ſuperſtruction: or elſe then there might have been no Symmetrie, but Antilogie and Antiſtaſie; no agreement, but a fighting of the materials of the building with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106774:17"/> the foundation, and one with another: and yet the building might ſtand well enough, ſuch incongruous ſuperſtructions, and unſuite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the foundation, were good enough then. 2. Either that Church was not the Church of the living God, ſuch as in which God lives, dwels and walks: or then God did live and dwell in dead perſons, who only make a Profeſſion of Religion: and then, either the Church was not a pillar and ground to bear up truth unto the world: or dead perſons, who only made a Profeſſion of Religion, might have done that office well enough. 3. Then either in the Church of God there was none, at leaſt there might have been a true Church offering, and yet no <hi>pure offering,</hi> no offering ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or then a pure offering, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſervice ſpirituall, holy and acceptable unto God, might have been offered by perſons who only did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Religion, were dead ſtones, having nothing of ſpirituality in them, but meer formality: and ſo hypocriticall, and amongſt the number of them that are moſt abominable. Let the Author, if he hold that difference, intimated in his reſtriction, between the Churches of the Old and New Teſtam. extricate himſelf of theſe things: which, I am much deceived, if he ſhall be able to do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe either he retract his reſtriction, or otherwiſe ſhoar upon ſome Socinian and Anabaptiſtick Fancy concerning the ancient Church.</p>

By this, when a perſon deſireth to be admitted a member of a Church, it followeth that his qualification is to be judged, not by the eſtimation of the whole Church, but of ſome ſpeciall members thereof: which is point-blank contrary to the Independent way of Government. The conſequence I prove. 1. thus: Either it muſt be ſaid that all and every one of the Church are truely converted <hi>de facto:</hi> or if that be not ſaid, this which we have ſaid doth una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follow: but the former will not be undertaken by the Author; becauſe it is point-blank contrary to plain Scripture, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us that many are called but few choſen: and this is confeſſed by ſuch as are moſt peremptory for his way of Church conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="*" place="margin">

I prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thus: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſpeaketh of ſuch men to be Judges, as are not only truely converted, but alſo <hi>very ſpirituall.</hi> Now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirituall importeth, I conceive, in plain Engliſh, if not a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative degree, yet certainly ſomewhat above the meer poſitive; to be very ſpirituall, is more, yea much more then ſimply to be really and truely ſpirituall: So that either he muſt of neceſſity ſay
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106774:18"/> that a Viſible Church muſt conſiſt of ſuch only, who are not only, ſimply true converts; but alſo much more, far advanced Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and ſo new born Babes, bruiſed reeds, and ſmoaking flax, muſt be held out, cruſhed, and quenched; or that which we ſaid muſt follow. Now I ſuppoſe yet further that moſt part of the Congregation be ſpirituall, but in the <hi>poſitive degree,</hi> and onely two or three, or a few number in compariſon, be <hi>very ſpiritual</hi> (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this may be by our Brethrens way of conſtituting a Church: for they grant ſuch as have any thing, the leaſt thing in truth of Chriſt appearing in them, are not to be excluded) then the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judging of the whole buſineſſe, muſt be devolved upon theſe few. Nay I muſt preſſe it yet further: Albeit it may be granted that when a Church is now compleatly conſtitute in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrality, and organized with all its members, it cannot be well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but there will be therein ſome ſuch men, <hi>very ſpirituall;</hi> at leaſt Rulers; whom if ſo be they had not of themſelves, while they were yet a gathering, yet it may well be ſuppoſed, that while they are yet but a gathering, all of them are but ſpirituall in the poſitive degree. For what hinders, but ſuch a company of perſons may come together to gather into a Church? Now, I pray, what ſhall be done in this caſe, if Church-mater in point of fitneſſe muſt paſſe by the eſtimation of men, more then poſitive in ſpiritualitie? Muſt it be ſaid in ſuch a caſe that though they be all ſatisfied in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience concerning the truth of one anothers converſion, Yet they are not fit mater to make themſelves a Church? I would ſee ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or ſhadow of reaſon for this. Yea it appeareth contrary to ſound reaſon, becauſe in homogeneall bodies (ſuch as a Church is, by the Doctrine of our Brethren, in the inſtance and period we are now ſpeaking to) what is ſufficient to conſtitute a part, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient alſo to conſtitute the whole. Therefore if Converſion and ſpiritualneſſe in the poſitive degree, be ſufficient for one member of the Viſible Church, its ſufficient alſo for the whole, I mean, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered yet as <hi>totum homogeneum.</hi> The Author would do well to aſſay a clearing and extricating of theſe things upon his Principles.</p>

The Church Myſticall, Inviſible, or according to its inward ſtate is the ſocietie of men effectually called unto ſaving communion with Chriſt, to which doth belong, in the intention and purpoſe of God, all the promiſes of ſpirituall bleſſings pertaining to life and ſalvation. The Church Viſible and conſidered according to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſtate, is the ſocietie of men profeſſing true Chriſtian faith and Religion, for communion in the outward exerciſes of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances of God: Admiſſion of members into the Church Inviſible is the work of God by the operation of the Spirit in Effectuall Calling and ingraffing men into Chriſt.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106774:22"/> thoſe of the Separation, are ſomewhat narrow at the firſt ſight, and ſeem to require exactneſſe of the higheſt ſtrain, and ſo ſpeaks for a candide interpretation of them, to wit, that when ſuch Phraſes of theirs occurre upon this Subject, as theſe: <hi>Onely the Saints, faithfull, called and ſanctified,</hi> are to be members of the Congregation: ſuch a conſtruction as this be put upon theſe words: perſons viſibly, externally ſuch to the judgement of charity, not alwayes really and internally ſuch, by the powerfull impreſſion of Gods free grace. Certainly ſome of them have ſo roundly affirmed that none ſhould be acknowledged members of the viſible Church, but ſuch as are true internall Saints, that hardly can ſuch a conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be put upon their words. See D. <hi>Holmes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barclets</hi> expreſſions ſet down by <hi>Daniel Cawdry</hi> in his Schem of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Independent way, <hi>n.</hi> 17. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockiers</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this purpoſe along his Lecture can as hardly ſuffer ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Others of them indeed have ſpoken more warily and in a lower ſtrain, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> himſelf, ſtating the Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 15. tells us perſons who, may be, are hypocrites inwardly; yet if their converſations and expreſſions be ſuch, that we cannot but conclude in charity, there may be and is ſome ſpirituall good in them, we ſay and hope, and are bound to conceive they are Saints; theſe are fit mater of a Viſible Church. Only it is to be obſerved that it cannot be well diſcerned by his words, whether he meaneth a <note n="*" place="margin">By a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee meane the elicting of an act of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereby we affirme the man to be ſuch: and by a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the abſtaining from affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> 
                     <hi>negative</hi> judgment of charity, or a <hi>poſitive:</hi> his words, as to this, are ſo wavering and fluctuating, and that very remarkably, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. <hi>end, and</hi> 15. <hi>begin.</hi> he ſpeaketh of the mater thus: <hi>So far as rationall charity directed by rule from the Word, a man can not but conclude that there may be ſome ſeeds of ſome ſpiritual work of grace in the heart.</hi> Here if we look at theſe words, <hi>A man can not but conclude,</hi> one would think that a poſitive judgement were intended: for that expreſſion doth import a neceſſity of elicting poſitively an act of judgement affirming of the ſubject, that form touching which the Queſtion is. But the next word which is but <hi>a may be</hi> (nothing being more ſaid there, before he concludeth the deſcription of Viſible Saints) ſeemeth to caſt down that and to import leſſe. Then a little after he expreſſeth clearly a poſitive judgement: <hi>we ſay and hope, and are bound to conceive they are</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106774:22"/> 
                     <hi>Saints.</hi> Again in propounding the ſtate of the Queſtion, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is involved in a cloud: <hi>We cannot conclude but in charity there may be and is ſome ſpirituall good in them,</hi> &amp;c. If we look at that, <hi>we cannot conclude but,</hi> &amp;c. one would think only a negative judgment were intended: for theſe words import no more but a neceſſity of abſtaining from an act of judgment, whereby the form in Queſtion is denyed of the ſubject, or the contrair thereunto af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. But when it is added, <hi>there may be and is,</hi> &amp;c, this ſeems to ſpeak for a poſitive. Before it was, <hi>we cannot but conclude;</hi> and therewith, <hi>there may be,</hi> only. Now it is, <hi>we cannot conclude but:</hi> and herewith <hi>there may be and is.</hi> I verily think the godly man has been at a puzzle in his conceptions about the mater.

By knowledge in the Fundamentall points of Religion, and ſuch other as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and neceſſary to be known for leading a life without ſcandal. 2. An experimentall work of Grace upon their hearts, of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and Faith in the LORD JESUS CHRIST. 3. A converſation, not only without ſcandall and offence before men (indeed <hi>Norton</hi> goeth no further) but alſo without neglect of any known duty, and commiſſion of any known ill, concerning which they muſt be a good ſpace tryed firſt in a way privat: if the Church be a gathering, by one another mutually, untill they be mutually ſatisfied in the judgement of charity touching the truth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106774:23"/> of the grace of each other. If it be in the admiſſion of additionall members, the triall is firſt by the Ruling Elder or Elders, both by way of diligent enquiry, for information, from others, and by way of conference with, and examination of the parties themſelves. Then all things being clear and ſatisfactory to the Elder, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being propounded to the Church, the people alſo muſt (as opportunity may ſerve them) try their ſpirituall condition, and that both wayes too. If theſe find no realitie of ſatisfaction, they preſent their diſſatisfaction to the Elder or Elders, which ſtayes the proceeding for the preſent. But if ſatisfaction hath been gotten by Elders and People in this privat way, then the perſons to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted muſt further (every one after another, if it be at the firſt gathering of the Church) make, firſt a publick confeſſion of their knowledge and faith in the grounds of Religion: then a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the experimentall work of their effectuall vocation. 1. In Repentance from dead works. 2. In their unfeigned faith towards the Lord Jeſus: and then muſt produce, if required, a teſtimony of their blameleſſe converſation.

And if ſo, whether he did now ceaſe to be a Viſible member of that former Church, and ſo of all Churches, by ſuiting to be a member of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> untill he was received in there? Then when he removed again from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> whether he laid down his memberſhip in that Church?

Then if he laid it down, whether he behoved to be ſtated a member in another Viſible Church, and then in another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he removed from one place to another? 2. Whereas the Author ſayes that the Diſciples at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> their carriage toward <hi>Paul</hi> was from light, and conſcience, and tenderneſſe in the mater of the conſtitution of the Viſible Church, and that they did fear they ſhould take in a heterogeneal peece, is evidently a bold fiction beſide the Text: And he muſt give me leave to doubt if he ſpoke that in good ſad-earneſt, can any man conceive any other thing to be meant by theſe words <hi>they all feared him,</hi> but this: that when as he had before been a violent perſecutor of Chriſtians, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he was ſtill ſuch an one, and might be now only ſeeking to inſinuate himſelf amongſt them as a Wolfe to deſtroy them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they feared him the ſame way that <hi>Ananias</hi> did, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of this ſame Chap.

Nay, I appeal to the Authors own conſcience, if upon ſerious looking again upon the words and the ſeries of the Story, himſelf can conceive otherwiſe of it. Now ſuch a fear as this, and that light, conſcience, and tenderneſſe in the mater of Church conſtitution are very different things. As for his Argumentative queſtioning, <hi>What did they fear? That he did not make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity? Why, now he tendered himſelf to do it,—but it is evident that they feared he did but meerly profeſſe, &amp;c.</hi> I <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis very poor and unbeſeeming a man of underſtanding
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106774:26"/> pretending to ſpeak ſeriouſly: I ſay, that was not it they feared, that he did not make Profeſſion of Chriſtianity: nor yet that, that he did but meerly profeſſe, taking meer Profeſſion only in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Profeſſion from a Principle of ſaving grace: but the thing they feared was his cruelty, which they had ſeen before, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but he was ſtill on that ſame way: and they feared his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf a Diſciple, and eſſaying to converſe familiarly with them, was but fraudulent counterfeiting to get advantage to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his cruelty. And <hi>Barnabas</hi> his bringing him to the Apoſtles, and his diſcourſe touching the Lords dealing with him (wherein I confeſſe there is ſo much, as might ſway their judgements to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him not only one ſeriouſly and <hi>ſine dolo malo</hi> Profeſſing Chriſtianity: but alſo a truely gracious convert, yea, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of Jeſus Chriſt too) was to take this fear out of their hearts, that they might without apprehenſion of danger converſe with him. And accordingly when the effect of <hi>Barnabas</hi> diſcourſe and information is ſet down, <hi>v.</hi> 28. we find not a word nor a hint of an Eccleſiaſtick admiſſion, or ſtating him into Church-memberſhip: But this is ſaid, <hi>he was with them coming in and going out at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, i. e.</hi> he was daily converſing familiarly with them. I need ſay no more to this Paſſage, but ſhall only adde this: Godly men would be more tender of Scripture then to uſe or rather to abuſe it thus; by ſhaping conceptions of their own, and then driving them into it by force.

But this is a very weak ground to bear up that ſuppoſition. Why, who knoweth not that oftentimes in the Greek Language, paſſive participles of the preſent tenſe are uſed in the ſignification of gerundive names: So that [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And ſo hath <hi>Beza</hi> and the old Latine Interpreters rendered it, <hi>qui ſalvi ſierent,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, <hi>ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> and ſo the word doth not neceſſarily import, as the Author would have it, that theſe added were, antecedently to their addition, <hi>ſaved</hi> by the begun work of grace in them (tho we are not denying but it might been ſo with them) and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that conſideration, and upon that account they were added. But this it doth import, that they were ſuch as God by the decree of Election had appointed to be ſaved, and that he added them to the Church as the means whereby they were to be actually made partakers of Salvation, as <hi>Calvine</hi> well taketh it up. 'Tis true, the <hi>Syriack</hi> Interpreter, as expounded by <hi>Tremel.</hi> hath it, <hi>qui ſalvi fiebant,</hi> but withall he hath the whole place thus, <hi>addebat quotidie eos qui ſalvi fiebant in Eccleſia, i. e.</hi> ſuch as were ſaved in the Church. 2.

It ſuppoſeth the Text to be ſpeaking of an Eccleſiaſtick procedure with perſons, upon outward triall and diſcerning; when as the Text is ſpeaking of no ſuch thing, but of a divine efficiency upon perſons. 3. He ſuppoſeth that all and every one that were then viſibly added to the Church, and none elſe were added but ſuch as were tranſlated to the ſtate of grace, partakers of the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> really in Chriſt, at leaſt ſo far as they could make judgement between things that differed: But firſt, I ask where doth he find, or how will he make out of the Text that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ſo far as they could make judgement,</hi> &amp;c. and that the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

I think this, in divine deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that indeed is meant, and he ſhall never inſtruct from the Text that which he ſaith. 2. How will he make out from the Text, that all and every one that were by Eccleſiaſtick admiſſion added to the Church, and none elſe? The Text indeed ſaith, <hi>the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch as were to be ſaved,</hi>

The Author muſt give us leave not to believe every thing upon his bare Aſſertion, and muſt finde out new Logick ere he prove that conſequence; ſo then we ſee not how this Scripture conſenteth to this point of Doctrine: the ſimple meaning of the wods being thus much, that daily the Lord was by his effectuall aſſiſting the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel, and working upon the hearts of men, bringing ſuch as he had a purpoſe to ſave unto the fellowſhip of the Church: that therein, as the ordinary way inſtituted by himſelf, they might be led on to the participation of eternall ſalvation. But this no

And was there never a Church ſince, untill they were erected of the new Independent frame and model? Were all the Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Aſia, Africk</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> in the times of the four famous Generall Counſels (the firſt whereof was about three hundred years after the Apoſtles time) now no Churches at all? Here indeed look out the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, <hi>ubi cubas in meridie,</hi> eſpecially if we'll conſider upon what

The Author ſuppoſeth that the Apoſtle here is ſpeaking to a <hi>Church of the Jews, i. e.</hi> to one particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, diſtinct from all the reſt of the Jewiſh Churches. This is but a bare Aſſertion without any proof or ſemblance of proof join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. We know that ſome of the Learned Interpreters take this Epiſtle to have been written not to any particular Church or Congregation, but to the whole multitude of the <hi>Jews</hi> profeſſing Chriſtian Religion, ſcattered abroad through the world, as were the Epiſtles of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> and have for them an argument not improbable from that 2.

'Tis true that others think otherwayes upon conſideration of what we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 19. where the divine Author deſires them he writes to, to pray for him, that he might be reſtored the ſooner to them, which ſeemeth to import a more limited compaſſe then the whole diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

He ſeems to ſuppoſe a clear untruth of theſe to whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>viz.</hi> that they did apoſtatize much, forſook their Aſſemblies, their mutuall exhorting with all the means of grace and life: Indeed the Apoſtle warneth them to take heed of theſe things, and ſpeaks of ſome that did ſo; but as for them he writeth unto, he layeth no ſuch thing to their charge as done by them, but giveth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the contrair, <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 32, 33, 34, 39. 4.

And I prove that it is to be Interpreted thus, and not as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> will have it.

But now is <hi>partaking of Chriſt</hi> nothing elſe but to be in a Viſible Church ſtate? Yea for confirmation let it be obſerved that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith not <hi>whoſe houſe ye are,</hi> but <hi>we are,</hi> ſo that he ſpeaks of ſome what under the metaphor of <hi>houſe</hi> which he ſuppoſeth common to him and them together. What was this? Viſible Church-member-ſhip of a certain (we are not told where reſiding) particular congregation of Jewes? Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> hes not heeded this, or has purpoſely paſſed it over. 5. There ſeemeth to me in Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> words here ſomewhat very like the <hi>Arminian</hi> apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy of Saints, <hi>while you hold faſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the practice and power of what you profeſſe, and when you let it go, &amp;c.</hi> is he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of this judgement, that men may have the practice and power of godlineſſe, and afterward let it go?

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> reaſon brought to prove that it is not ſpoken of the Church Inviſible, is but weak: which will appear the better if it be put into form (for it is ſomewhat confuſedly propounded by himſelf) as I conceive it may be thus: That Church is underſtood
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106774:30"/> here which is capable of viſible &amp; limited Diſciplin; but the Church Inviſible is not capable of this: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c. Anſ.</hi> 1. How is the Major or firſt Propoſition proven? By inſinuation thus: <hi>He ſpeaks of the power of the keyes, binding and looſing on earth.</hi> What thence? <hi>Ergo,</hi> he ſpeaks before of ſuch a Church as is capable of viſible limited Diſcipline. If I deny the Conſequence; how will he prove it? I do not ſee it, nor think he ſhall ever be able to make it out. 2. But to paſſe the Propoſition, let's ſee the proof of the Aſſumption. <hi>The Inviſible Church is the greateſt part in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they which are in earth as one with them, as one entire univerſall body whereof Chriſt is the Head, are not capable of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That part of the univerſall Church which is in Heaven is impertinently brought on the ſtage here: Chriſt is ſpeaking of thoſe that are yet to be built, or are a building; therefore we ſay He is ſpeaking of ſuch as are on earth. 2. Albeit that part of the Inviſible Church that is on earth be not capable of viſible and limited Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, <hi>formally conſidered as ſuch, i. e.</hi> as the Inviſible Church: nor yet <hi>collectively</hi> conſidered, as one intire body: yet the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church <hi>materially, i. e.</hi> theſe that are the Inviſible Church, being alſo a part of the Church viſible, and conſidered <hi>diſtributive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in parrs, may be capable of viſible Diſcipline. <hi>David, Peter, John,</hi> and the reſt who make up the Church Inviſible, as they are alſo outward Profeſſours with others, are capable of viſible Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. O! then you will ſay, why? Are they not ſpoken of here, <hi>I will build my Church,</hi> as they are a viſible Church. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It doth not neceſſarly follow: for to perſons ſtanding under diverſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, one thing may be attributed, according to one conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and another according to another.</p>

If by the name of the Church here be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Church Viſible, as ſome later Orthodox Divines have expounded it, namely judicious and learned <hi>Hudſon</hi> in his acurate and elaborate Vindication of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>

But ſuppoſing this place to ſpeak of the viſible Church, it cannot be underſtood of a particular viſible Church or Congregation, but muſt of neceſſity be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Catholick viſible Church, becauſe it is ſuch a Church
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106774:31"/> as is to ſtand firm and impregnable that the gates of hell cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it: but any particular Church may be prevailed againſt. 2. Taking the name of the <hi>Church</hi> ſo, here the meaning of the whole ſentence <hi>upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> is nothing elſe but this (as the learned Author, but now cited, well obſerveth) that the Profeſſion and Doctrine of this Truth, that the Meſſiah is already come, &amp; that this Jeſus is the Meſſiah, &amp; this Jeſus the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah is the Son of God, the Doctrine and confeſſion that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2, 3. and the beleeving that <hi>I am he</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24. is the foundation whereon the Church of the New Teſt. is to be built; out of all which nothing more can follow, as to the qualification of members of the viſible Church, of the New Teſt. then this; that when as the Jews under the Old Teſt. beleeved in an indefinite Meſſiah to come: now under the New Teſt. none can be of the Chriſtian Church, but ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves and confeſſes that the Meſſiah is come, &amp;c. Now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all the Orthodox World, if Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> his commenting upon this place be not a forcing of the Text.

What is that (<hi>viz.</hi> rule) by the Word of God? To confirme this is brought the teſtimony of the ſame Author. 5. By the Court which is without the Temple is meant men which have only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Religion and devotion, but are deſtitute of the power thereof. 6.

                  <p>2. That in the whole diſcourſe upon this place Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſpeaks ſo, as that he cannot be Interpret, but to hold none to be members of the Viſible Church, but ſuch as are endued with true ſaving grace and the power of Godlineſſe <hi>in veritate rei:</hi> He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once in it mentioneth that qualification, <hi>ſo far as men can judge:</hi> Yea, his expreſſions are ſuch as cannot poſſiblie admit it, as will appear in following the particulars; To which now we come.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>6</label> We begin with ſome notes upon the concluſion. 1. I aske here what he underſtands by <hi>meer profeſſing the things of God?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch profeſſing, as is oppoſite to, and deſtitute of, even mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ordinary ſeriouſneſſe, which may ſometimes be without an inward ſaving worke of grace; yea or outward convincing poſitive evidences of it: Or as it is oppoſite unto an inward ſaving work?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106774:32"/> If he meant the former, he ſhall not have us to contradict his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; we ſhall grant him that ſuch as have not ſo much as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>morally</hi> ſerious profeſſion, ſuch as evidently profeſſe the things of God hiſtrionically, mockingly, manifeſtly purpoſing to deceive, are neither allowed of Chriſt, nor to be admitted by men as mater of the Viſible Church. If he ſay the other, and ſo that none are to be admitted into the Viſible Church, but ſuch as beſide profeſſion, have alſo really true, inward, ſaving grace, he putteth the Church upon an impoſſibility; and in this will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by all the judicious of his way. If it ſhall be ſaid, it may be he meaneth neither, but ſuch a profeſſion as is oppoſite to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive convincing evidences of grace to the judgement of diſcerning men, and ſo far as they can judge. I ſay, 1. This is not ſaid by himſelf there, nay, he cannot ſay it and hold to all what he ſaith here. Why? becauſe ſome may be ſuch, as far as men can judge, and yet ſuch as Chriſt will caſt out, yea, and hath caſten out: and men may be ſuch and yet fit to deſtroy the holy City. 2. Perſons may be ſuch as are not approved and allowed mater by the Lord <hi>in the Viſible Church,</hi> and yet the Church may admit them into the Church, without any perill in order to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> without ſinning by admitting them: as for inſtance, <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> If he ſay he meanes not here the Lords not approving &amp; not allowing perſons <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> and in point of their duty, but in relation to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick proceeding with them, <hi>in foro exteriore;</hi> he ſhall not have us diſſentient from him about this in the generall. But him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath never this diſtinction of the Lords approving or not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, when from it at any time he reaſoneth to the admitting or not admitting of ſuch perſons. Yea for ought that can be perceived along this Peece, he ſeemeth alwayes to ſpeak of Gods approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or not-approbation of perſons in point of their own dutie &amp; <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter.</hi> But now to put the moſt candid conſtruction and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation upon his concluſion, let it be ſo, that by mater not approven and not-allowed of the Lord in the Viſible Church is meant not-approved and not-allowed (no <hi>ſimpliciter</hi>) but in relation to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick proceeding, <hi>in foro exteriore:</hi> and by perſons meerly profeſſing, be meant perſons not truely gracious (not of neceſſity in truth of exiſtence, but) at leaſt ſo far as men can diſcern and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106774:33"/> judge. Come we now to ſee what ſhadow of this point is in the Scripture alledged here: I ſhall go through the grounds laid down from it in order.</p>

If the Catholick Viſible Church, I ſhall grant that the ſtate and welfare thereof though never ſo much infeſted ſhall not be left and ruined utterly: But I doubt much if Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> will acknowledge ſuch a Viſible Church: ſure I am, theſe of his way, are very averſe from acknowledging it, (though it be a thing moſt certain and clear in the Word of God) becauſe indeed the granting of it undermines all the frame of their Independent way: Yea and he himſelf all along his Peece, treating of the mater of the Viſible Church, ſpeaks of a Viſible Church, which is nothing elſe but a particular Congregation.

Were theſe things then left looſe to be diſpoſed on and ordered at mens pleaſure? I wot not well what this reſtriction means; but ſure I am it looks ill-favouredly: The Author will do well to clear himſelf in it. 2. But how will he prove, that which he only takes here for granted, that the intention of the Spirit of God in this Scripture is to hold forth a generall rule concerning the outward conſtitution of the Viſible Church, as to the mater there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and how members ought to be qualified for admiſſion to it, and not rather in a Propheticall viſion, to fortell what was to come to paſſe <hi>de facto</hi> concerning the Church-worſhip, and adherers to the true worſhip; ſundry learned Interpreters conceive that this latter is the intention and purpoſe of this viſion, that the true Church, the true worſhip of God, and the worſhippers after that true maner of worſhip of God inſtituted by himſelf, was to be brought to great

The Court which is without (or as ſome others read, within) and to be caſten out; others underſtand far otherwayes, not of perſons, but of the outward and viſible face and ſtate of the Church; and by the caſting of it out, rejecting, caſting off care of it, and giving of it over for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> of Antichriſts power and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to be poſſeſſed by Antichriſtian and idolatrous people, becauſe of their following and practiſing heatheniſh-like wayes and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: So <hi>Merhiſton.</hi> And certainly it is very likely that the Court here cannot denotate perſons, I mean profeſſours to be caſten out of the Viſible Church; becauſe it is ſaid to be given to the heathen, and theſe heathen are theſe very perſons, that are ſaid to be caſten out. The Interpretation in <hi>Marlorat</hi> is exceeding harſh, and hath no probability in congruity of ſpeech, to wit, to caſt out hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and idolaters, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Court, becauſe it is given to the heathen. 1. Becauſe they are become like the infidel heathens. Where ſhall we finde the like ſpeech, that perſons are ſaid to be given unto ſuch and ſuch perſons becauſe they are become like unto them. 2. But grant, by this Court perſons are meant, and that by not meaſuring of them is meant not imbraceing of them, but caſting them out. How doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> prove, that theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are all ſuch as have but an outſide of worſhip, and are deſtitute of the power of Religion, even albeit their Religion be true and

What if I ſhall ſay, not ſuch perſons, but Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, idolatrous perſons are underſtood hereby? What can he bring from the Text, or reaſon to prove what he ſaith? 3. Let's ſee his reaſons he bringeth to ſhew that ſuch as have only an outſide wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Religion, and devotion, but are deſtitute of the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are not to be imbraced as mater of the Viſible Church, but held out or caſt out. The 1. is brought from <hi>Marlorat,</hi> becauſe the houſe, ſaith he, is ſpirituall, and holy, they are not congruous mater, <hi>ne complectaris eos in ſpirituali aedificio Domini. Anſ.</hi> 1. That ſpirituall houſe or <hi>aedifice Marlorat</hi> ſpeaks of, is the true Church Inviſible, <hi>ſpirituali aedificio Domini quod nunquam cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruere poterit:</hi> Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> has ſlipped theſe words. 2. <hi>Marlorat</hi> comprehends under theſe that are the Court, all the reprobate mixed with the Elect, tho they were even as guilded hypocrites, as of whom it may be ſaid (which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſaith) they are true converts as far as men can judge; as is evident all along. 3. <hi>Marlorat</hi> ſpeaks not of caſting them out of viſible ſocietie with the ſpirituall houſe of the Elect, by <hi>Diſciplinarie</hi> ejection of ſingular perſons diſtinctly, (but by <hi>Doctrinall</hi> conviction, and denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deſtruction againſt them) except in the caſe of evidently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted rebellion or obſtinacy.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106774:35"/> As we ſaid before it is altogether improbable that by the Court is meant perſons, but a thing, and it ſeemeth to be a moſt forced ſenſe, and without example, <hi>given up to the Gentiles, i. e. they are become like the Gentiles.</hi> Next we ſay it is moſt evident from the end of this <hi>ver.</hi> that the Spirit ſpeaks not theſe words as a rule preſcribing what he or others ſhould do in governing the Church; but as a prediction of ſomewhat that was to come to paſſe, this I ſay is evident by the deſignation of the circumſtance of the time or duration of that which is ſpoken of in the end of the verſ. But 2ly. Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſuppoſeth two things which he mainly ſhould have proven, that the outer-court-Chriſtians are all that have not the power of Godlineſſe in their heart, though their profeſſion and practice in Religion be objectively right and true, and ſubjectively ſerious. 2. That caſting them out and not meaſuring them muſt be underſtood of Diſciplinarie ejection, upon that very account that they have not the power of Godlineſſe. 3. As to that he addeth himſelf <hi>ſuch kind of Profeſſours will ſoon in times of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis true, they may be ready to do ſo; but tell me, will not even ſome ſuch fine, well guilded Profeſſours, who may ſeem as far as men can judge to have the power of Godlineſſe in their heart, be ſuch as will be ready ſoon to do the ſame? Yes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when all is done they may be but outſide Profeſſours. <hi>Simon Magus, Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> muſt have been at their reception into the Church, by Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> principles, ſuch as were true converts ſo far as men could judge; yet we ſee them ready ſoon to conform themſelves to the worſt of men. Thus, I humbly conceive, we have made it clear that Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> hath little ground for his doctrine from this Text, moſt part of the pillars of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe being meer ſuppoſitions, taken for granted, but having no light of proof from the words, as alſo that he had as little cauſe to boaſt of <hi>Marlorats</hi> complying with it unawars.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here again we are to mark the Concluſion that Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> would be at, touching the mater of the Viſible Church, <hi>ſuch as are all indeed from above,</hi> as have <hi>indeed</hi> an internall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, the Law given into the mind, made Jews <hi>inwardly,</hi> an holy Nation, according <hi>to inward choiſe and call.</hi> Here indeed is an Anabaptiſticall model of the Viſible Church, all reall ſaints, and not in the judgement of charity only. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, <hi>Lockiers ſo far as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men can judge,</hi> as it is wholly left out by himſelf, ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be admitted to have any place here. 1. Becauſe he ſaith they are all indeed from above, and have indeed an internall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, that <hi>indeed</hi> I think to every mans apprehenſion noteth <hi>veritatem rei in ſe,</hi> or <hi>judicio veritatis</hi> (as they call it) as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed a <hi>judicio charitatis</hi> of ſpirituall men. 2. Becauſe that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. cited from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. brought in by him for confirmation of his purpoſe, he is ſpeaking of, (of the impertinency whereof to the purpoſe in hand, I mean, the conſtitution of the Viſible Church, we ſhall ſpeak preſently) ſpeaketh of truth and reality of grace in the heart, I may ſay, in the very judgement of God himſelf under which there is no poſſibility of miſtake; But to the grounds he goeth upon from this Text. 2. He taketh for granted, that this whole Chapter is taken up to ſhew the ſtate of the Viſible Church in its conſtitution, as ſuch, and that it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits intention in the viſion ſet down in it, to give unto <hi>John</hi> a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern thereof to be a rule to him and others then, and ſucceeding ages, for regulating the conſtitution of it, and particularly in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106774:36"/> point of Church-members; but why did he not aſſay ſome proofe of this: Muſt we take every thing upon his bare aſſertion? 'Tis true, Learned <hi>Brightman</hi> in his commentary conceiveth that this viſion containeth a common Type of the holy Church in all ages. But 1. In all the progreſſe of his commentarie on that Chapter, I find not any evident paſſage pointing at any particular in the viſion, as a patern, type, or rule, concerning the qualification of ſuch as are to be admitted in the external fellowſhip of the Viſible Church, as the homogeneall parts of the outward viſible body. 2. Though I will not ſtay here to examine the intent of all the particulars in that viſion, and though I eſteem much of the judgement of that learned and pious man; yet in the generall, I muſt ſay, I find no convincing argument, nor much appearance of any argument at all brought by him to prove that the intent of the viſion was to give <hi>John</hi> a patern, a certain portraicture or reſemblance of the Church, whereby we might know which is ſhe. Yea albeit I confeſſe ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars in the viſion are things of the Church (in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation whereof I would not much diſagree from <hi>Brightman</hi>) yet I think he is miſtaken in taking that for the generall intent and purpoſe of the viſion: and conceives that <hi>John</hi> being now to receive a new Propheticall Revelation concerning theſe things that were to come to paſſe in and upon the Church from that time to the end of the World, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>fin.</hi> The intention of the viſion of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to deſcribe and ſet forth the Glory and Majeſty of God the Father, the firſt Author of the Propheſie, as in the next Chapter is deſcribed the Son the Mediatour and ſubordinate Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it is ordinary when the Lord is to communicate to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and by them to the Church, Propheticall Revelations of great things to come to paſſe concerning the Church, to preſent by way of preparation ſome glorious repreſentation of himſelf, as we may ſee, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. See theſe words of the learned and judicious <hi>Gomarus</hi> upon that Chapter, on the Margin<note n="*" place="margin">

And certainly had it been the purpoſe of the Spirit, by this viſion to hold forth a patern, portraicture, and reſemblance of the true Church common to all ages, leaſt becauſe of troubles and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, we ſhould either think it utterly extinguiſhed, or at leaſt through ignorance of her right form and figure, we ſhould be leſſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106774:36"/> able to know which is ſhe (as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith) it ſeemeth the wiſedom of the Spirit of God would have portraicted the figure and form of the Church in theſe things that are moſt ſubſtantiall in the conſtitution of it, ſo as Chriſtians of ordinary capacitie might been able to diſcern &amp; take up the true Church by; but Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> himſelf is even troubled to find what things are meant by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular in the viſion. And in ſome he bringeth but meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, yea and likely is miſtaken, as, could we ſtay, might be very probably ſhown; as for example, in his Expoſition of the ſea of Glaſſe like Chriſtall before the Throne. 3. But what is the particular in the viſion from which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> deduceth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions? this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was in Heaven he ſaw it, <hi>a door was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Heaven and the Throne was ſet in Heaven, this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was to ſhadow that the—worſhippers ſhould be indeed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, &amp;c.</hi> and to make it the ſtronger, it is confirmed by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what was done with <hi>Moſes, Moſes had his patern upon the Mount nigh Heaven, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is a thing begged for a ground, that as <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken up to the Mount to get a patern of theſe things, which he was to appoint in the ancient Church, ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> is here taken up to get a patern of the Viſible Church, and the things to be ordered in it under the New Teſt. This, I ſay, is groundleſly ſuppoſed: For theſe things that were to be done by <hi>Moſes</hi> were but now a inſtituting, and to be firſt ſet up: and therefore it was neceſſary that he ſhould have a patern of them repreſented to him to regulate him; but ere the time of this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Chriſt had fully inſtituted all particulars belonging to the Church of the New Teſtament, and many Churches through the World, were already actually ſetled and ordered according to that inſtitution, and beſide ſundry of the Books of the New Teſt. writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, wherein the inſtitution and rule was already plainly written down, and this indeed is one reaſon which inclineth me to think that the ſcope and intention of the Spirit in this viſion was not to give a patern, and portraicture, or modell of the Viſible Church for the time to come. 2. As to that alledged meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> receiving his patern near Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew of what qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the people, <hi>i. e.</hi> the members of the ancient Viſible Church ſhould be, (<hi>viz. in foro exteriori,</hi> ſo muſt he underſtand it, if he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106774:37"/> ſpeak to the purpoſe in hand) I will not trouble my ſelf to inquire who may be theſe very learned men that ſay ſo. But the thing it ſelf is but a conjecture: and I deſire Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> concerning this, and the expounding of Heaven here, to remember the axiome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Schoole-men themſelves, otherwiſe doting on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, <hi>theologia ſymbolica non eſt Argumentativa,</hi> except where the Spirit of God himſelf openeth the ſignification. 3. I deſire to know what Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> meaneth by <hi>perſons really living very near Heaven,</hi> if truely gracious, then what difference between thoſe, and theſe afterward brought in with an adverſative oppoſing them to the former, and why did he propound his Doctrine with a reſtriction to the time of the Goſpel? 4. That patern which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had ſhown to him in the Mount, according to which he was commanded to make, did not concern the conſtitution of the body of the then Viſible Church, of what, and how qualified perſons it was to be made up. But was a patern of the Tabernacle and the things pertaining to it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 9. 40. <hi>S.</hi> The place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 7. referred as ſpeaking of the ordinary members of the then Viſible Church is not to the purpoſe, for it ſpeaks of ſuch as were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Prieſts Office.

I appeal to all judicious Chriſtians in the World, and to Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> himſelf in ſecond ſerious thoughts, if that Scripture was intended to be a rule of conſtituting Congregations: Or if it be not a declaration or revelation of Gods purpoſe and Decree what he is to do himſelf by his efficacious grace; and if that Covenant and the promiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of belongeth not in the fulfilling thereof only to the Lords elect.</p>

                     <hi>The Churches of the Romanes, Corinthians, Epheſians, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Colloſſians, Theſſalonians, of the Jews which are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Peter, Iames, and the Author to the Hebrews, and in the Acts, were all thus conſtitute of truely Godly, ſo far as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man can make judgement of one like himſelf, Ergo. if theſe be denyed as preſidents, then I would aske our Brethren of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery by what rule they walk?

Anſ.</hi> Where did Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> read, that the judgement comed and yet lying upon theſe Churches, came upon them for their admitting and permitting to be in their viſible ſociety ſuch as were not true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, ſuch as God the ſearcher of the hearts of all men can bear witneſſe of as indeed ſealed for his by his Holy Spirit, as far as men truely converted and very ſpirituall can diſcern and judge?

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106774:38"/> Brethren by what rule they walk) import: But we truſt ere we have done, to find a rule elſe-where; yet we ſhall not deny nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe theſe Churches as preſidents in this buſineſſe, in whatſoever can be made clear to have been their practice in this mater, I mean, the notion and conſideration under which perſons were admitted unto, and reckoned in their externall Church-fellowſhip. Come we then to conſider the antecedent of this Argument, or what is affirmed in his induction of theſe Churches. Firſt in the generall, and then his proof thereof particularly. The aſſertion of them all in generall is, that all of them were conſtitute of perſons truely Godly ſo far as Godly men could make judgement. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> if he would have made the <hi>attributum</hi> of this induction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his concluſion intended, he ſhould have ſaid they were conſtitute of perſons <hi>all and every one of them</hi> truely Godly, <hi>and none elſe.</hi> But he ſpeaks only indefinitely, which might be granted: But let us take him to mean ſo; this aſſertion as it lyeth, may be granted in ſome ſenſe which it may carry, and never a whit advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage redound thereby to his Doctrine; for it may carry this ſenſe, that theſe Churches were made up, or did conſiſt of perſons all of them truely mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now in the firſt ſenſe it might be granted (as I ſuppoſe ſome Congregation or Congregations may be ſuch <hi>eventually,</hi> that all the members may be truely godly) &amp; yet no advantage come thereby to his Tenet, unleſſe he could prove that the enumeration which he makes is a perfect enumeration of all the particular Churches in Scripture (which he cannot, becauſe it is clearly contrary to truth, and therefore his induction is imperfect) Yea and this alſo, that there is no other Paſſage of Scripture, that holds forth a rule or warrand of any larger latitude touching ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of members into the fellowſhip of the Viſible Church then what is ſaid of theſe Churches. He muſt prove then the aſſertion in the latter ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe Churches were conſtitute of perſons all truely godly as far, &amp;c. <hi>formally</hi> conſidered as ſuch, and under no other conſideration, in their in-taking and being rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned members in their outward viſible ſocietie: If he could prove
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106774:38"/> this of any one of them we ſhould go over to his ſide of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie: But now ſee how he proveth this, nay all that is brought or can be brought by him, is only this, that the Apoſtle Writing to theſe Churches, calleth them <hi>ſaints, beleevers, ſanctified in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and the like, which ſhould we grant to mean inward true grace of regeneration, and to be ſpoken not of the whole body <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively</hi> and <hi>confuſe,</hi> only giving the denomination of the whole from the better part; but <hi>diſtributively</hi> of all and every one of them; yet nothing elſe could neceſſarily be concluded from this, but that they were ſuch <hi>de facto</hi> and <hi>quo ad eventum,</hi> and not that they were gathered and received into the externall fellowſhip of theſe Churches formally upon this and no other account: that they were ſuch reall, internall, truely regenerate ſaints. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the place cited ſpeaks not, nor intimates one word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the order of proceeding, or account whereupon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was made in the viſible externall conſtituting and ſetting up of theſe Churches, or admitting of members into them, neither doth Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſo much as once aſſay to make a proofe of this point; only after he hes cited ſome paſſages concerning the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he ſaith, pag.</hi> 22. <hi>end, and pag.</hi> 23. <hi>begin. that theſe expreſſions ſhould import that they did conſtitute &amp; gather together upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, but as there was the true grace of God evident as far as men could judge, I cannot indeed ſee.</hi> Alas! 1. Is this to prove that which being the very main pinch of the Queſtion, to ſay no more for it, but you cannot ſee how it was not done ſo. 2. But I forbear to exaggerat this way of reaſoning. We are ſure he might ſee in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture how perſons were gathered and received into the fellowſhip of the Viſible Church upon another account, and truſt by the Lords aſſiſtance ere we have done to let it be ſeen by ſuch as will not ſhut their eyes upon the light of the Word. Thus we have ſaid already, doth ſufficiently diſcover the weakneſſe and nullity of the inductive Argument to the point in controverſie. And I muſt ſay, I wonder that Learned men (ſuch as I do with all reſpect, acknowledge our Independent Brethren to be) ſhould have put ſuch confidence in it.</p>

Anſw.</hi> 1. We will not ſay it is a temporary faith he ſpeaks of, we grant it to be a ſaving perſevering faith, and for confirmation of this he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſtronger ground from the Text then theſe he hath choſen, that they are all called <hi>beloved of God,</hi> and <hi>called Saints,</hi> where, as <hi>Eſtius</hi> noteth well, <hi>intelligitur vocatio non communis &amp; exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> is underſtood, not common and outward calling, but that whereby men are effectually called to faith, holineſſe, and ſalvation, which is the calling according to purpoſe and Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But now will Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> or any man take upon them to ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> mean'd that all and every one in the Viſible Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſuch as had not a temporary faith only, but a true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, and ſo were all and every one ſuch as were to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſaved.

I think to ſay it, would be accounted a Dream. As for report, of every one of them and their ſeverall evidences of grace, by others. 1. We have as little ground of conjecture for that, though we find that there hes been great fame of their faith in common and in generall, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. 2. Report may be a ground of charitable beliefe (I take beleef here in the generall logicall ſignification of it, as it is contradiſtinguiſhed from opinion and ſcience) but it cannot be a ground of a poſitive diſcretive judgement, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth to <hi>Paul</hi> touching the <hi>Romanes</hi> faith, for it implyes a mans own perſonall experience of things. 2. We ſay the Apoſtle in theſe titles of <hi>beloved of God, Saints, Beleevers,</hi> meaneth true ſaving grace, truely exiſting, and not in the judgement of charity only: But ſpeaketh there not of all the Romanes <hi>univerſaliter &amp; diſtributivè,</hi> as we ſay all men are ſinners, but <hi>communiter &amp; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectivè, &amp; confuſè, i. e.</hi> in common, collectively, and confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe undoubtedly ſaving grace was amongſt them, and he could not take upon him to determine, whether moe or fewer of them were endued with it, and as it ſeems knew nothing to the contrary of any of them particularly, but they might be ſuch. Thus verily I think the Apoſtles writing to whole Churches, and calling them generally by the name of Saints, faithfull, &amp;c. may well be underſtood; and no other thing can be demonſtrate of their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Take herewith the judgement of the Learned Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on the place, all of which do unanimouſly determine that theſe titles of Saints, faithfull, and the like, are given by the Apoſtles to the Churches; partly in reſpect of the end of their calling, and the duty of every one in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that the end of their

Anſw.</hi> 1.

This is a groſs, foule ſlip, I will not ſay it hath been done out of deſigne, may be it hes been done inconſiderately, without preſent turning over to the place; however, adding to the Word of God is a dangerous practice. 2. <hi>As for that to ſay that this Church did conſtitute and gather upon another account, &amp;c.</hi> we have noted on it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently before. I adde now this, by what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſaith here,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106774:40"/> and indeed by the Doctrine of all the Independent Brethren of his way, in this mater of the conſtitution of the Viſible Church, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that their conception about the order of gathering the Viſible Church by the Apoſtles was this, that men being firſt turned to the Profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, there was a tryall made of their evidences of true inward ſaving grace, and ſuch as eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſatisfactory of this were found in, theſe were gathered in, and the reſt caſten by, which I dare ſay is a meer fiction, of which not the leaſt veſtige can be ſhown in Scripture, and never man dreamed of untill theſe ſad times, broodie of many new fancies under the name of new lights. 3. I confeſſe perſons having ſuch grace in them as ſhall be confirmed to the end, as keeps them waiting for the coming of Chriſt, as are the comfortable ſeals of a faithfull Miniſtry, are not outward Profeſſours only, but are reall Saints and Elect, and thence I conclude, it cannot be underſtood univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally of all and every one of the Viſible Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Will he ſay that all and every one were reall Saints, Elect, to be confirmed unto the end, and ſo eternally ſaved; if he ſay, yes, in <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, ſo far as he could judge upon evidences of true grace. I ſay, 1. That is an addition to the Text, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith ſimply he ſhall confirm you unto the end, &amp;c. not ſo far as I can judge he ſhall confirm you. Yea, 2. It enervats the comfort held forth by the Apoſtle to them he ſpeaks to, for it imports no more upon the mater, but this, poſſibly ye may be confirmed to the end, and ſo when all is done ye may be poſſibly not confirmed to the end: (mans judgement can go no further) and is contrary to the ſtrain of all the Orthodox, writing againſt the Remonſtraints in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of perſeverance, who underſtand the place of Saints, and the Lords effectuall gracious preſerving them <hi>in veritate rei,</hi> and ſo make uſe of the place, and preſſe it againſt the Remonſtrants. But let Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> rid himſelf here; if he will have <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak thus of all and every one of the Viſible Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> either he muſt conceive it ſpoken only with relation to the ſtate of that Church as its firſt up-ſetting: or alſo in relation to what it was at the preſent time of the Writing of this Epiſtle: The former cannot be ſaid, becauſe its moſt evident all along that Paſſage, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. he is ſpeaking of it as ſtill, at the time of his writing, ſtanding in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106774:41"/> he expreſſeth in his words, albeit ſome of the Verbs be uſed in the preterit perfect tenſe, no man can deny this who hath any judgement.

Anſw.</hi> 1. Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> affirmeth more then he proves well, in calling that anſwer a conceit contrary to the ſtream of the words and ſcope of the Text. His firſt Argument comes to this much; All theſe are of the Church, which is ſaid to be redeemed by the blood of God, whom the Elders and Officers are required to attend; But the Apoſtle requires them to attend all the flock without putting difference between perſon and perſon, <hi>ergo.</hi> all the flock, <hi>i. e.</hi> every one of the Viſible Church are of that Church which is ſaid to be redeemed <hi>&amp;c. Anſ.</hi> What ever might be ſaid of his Interpretation of the flock to be the Viſible Church as Viſible, we deny the neceſſity of the Major Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106774:43"/> The flock as it is the object of the Miniſters externall charge and adminiſtration of Ordinances, may be of a larger extent and comprehenſion, then is the ſignification of the Church as it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under that attribute of being redeemed by the blood of God.

The ſecond argument: <hi>nay upon this ground the Elders ſhould not know,</hi> &amp;c. To ſay it, with reverence to the memory of the Author, is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any body of common judgement, exceedingly weak; For, 1. How followeth that, if the Church redeemed by the blood of God, be the Elect only, then the Elders ſhould not know what their care was, nor upon whom they ſhould beſtow it, for it muſt have this for a reaſon of it, that Church which is ſaid to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the only object of the Elders care, which they are required to attend. This we deny, we ſay they are part of it, with <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker.</hi> 2. How weak is that, they might reply, we cannot ſearch into thy ſecrets to perceive who are Elect—and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to feed them. Then it ſeems by the Reverend mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, when our Lord laid that charge upon <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> 20. <hi>feed my Sheep, my Lambs,</hi> which are no other, but theſe ſame he ſpeaks of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 26, 27. <hi>i. e.</hi> only elect ones, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28, 29. he might have replied, Lord I cannot ſearch thy ſecrets to know who are theſe thine elect; and therefore I cannot tell how to feed them. It is not neceſſary or a Paſtour to feed the Elect, that he know diſtinctly who are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106774:44"/> the ſingular perſons by the head, but for feeding by publick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it is ſufficient that he know them confuſedly, that they are there in the Congregation; and if he have any grounds of a poſitive judgement concerning particular perſons, that indeed gives him further advantage to apply himſelf to thoſe in a more particularly applicatory way. If indeed it were the Miniſters work to feed <hi>efficaciter,</hi> to give the increaſe (as the Apoſtle expreſſeth the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all efficaciouſneſſe, or efficiency of grace) and they were required to feed the elect that way, I confeſſe if the Lord did not diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point out the particular perſons to them; then they might make ſuch a reply, Lord I cannot ſearch into thy ſecrets to perceive who are theſe, &amp;c. but the efficiency of grace is in Gods own hand alone, and the Miniſter has upon him but an externall, morall, ſuaſive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, which he is to diſpenſe for the good of the elect, but he needeth not for that know them diſtinctly, it is enough, he knowes they are there, where he diſpenſeth them, and let God diſcern and waile them out from the reſt. 3. It is a groundleſſe ſuppoſition, and contrary to the truth, that in the current and common ſenſe of Scripture, that <hi>redeemed</hi> being ſpoken of ſpirituall redemption from ſin, and eternall wrath, (as for the name <hi>[ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified]</hi> it is not in this text, and therefore is impertinently brought in here) is taken for <hi>redeemed viſibly,</hi> though not <hi>really.</hi> I doubt he can bring many paſſages of Scripture, wherein it can with any appearance be ſo exponed; yea viſibly redeemed, is an expreſſion in my judgement ſtrange to Scripture: Let this ſuffice us in anſwer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker</hi> in this particular: We doubt not but Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furd,</hi> will have more full and acurate conſiderations on it.</p>

The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> clearly writeth to the Elect, truely regenerated, who have obtained the like precious faith with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are kept by the power of God to ſalvation, rejoiced in the hope thereof, though they had not ſeen Chriſt yet loved him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving on him, rejoiced with joy unſpeakable and full of glory, already (in the firſt fruits, and undoubted intereſt) received the end of their faith, the ſalvation of their ſouls. What? Are theſe things that uſe to be given or attributed to hypocrites (ſuch as Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Viſible Saints may be) and that in ſuch a poſitive way? Or were there never a hypocrite in theſe Viſible Churches of the Jews? 2. The place of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſpeaks of the Churches in <hi>Iudaea</hi> indefinitely and collectively, not univerſally; ſaith not that all and every one of them endured ſuch perſecution and trialls, again, ſuppoſe they did ſo after they were Church members, this is nothing to the point in hand; the Queſtion is upon what account they were taken in. It ſeemeth he ſaw this, and therefore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth that <hi>Profeſſion did then generally expoſe unto ſuch trialls.</hi> But undertaking of a profeſſion of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expoſing to trials, if there be not actuall aſſaulting, is no ſufficient ground or evidence poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to hold a man truely gracious ſo far as men can judge. 3. Such wonders and ſignes as the Goſpel was accompanied with then, may be as forcible to draw men without change of heart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the profeſſion of it (as we ſee in <hi>Simon Magus</hi>) as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats call and countenancing of it, when there is no ſuch miracles and ſignes; and therefore there is not ſuch inequality between pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106774:46"/> then and now, nor ſuch inequall dealing in comparing the one profeſſion with the other as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> imagines.</p>

If that maxime hold good <hi>à facto ad jus non valet argumentum,</hi> becauſe ſuch things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to be, will not hold; then Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive argument for any thing alleadged in it falls to the ground without force; for all that you have alledged in it is a mater of fact; and therefore I may retort upon you thus: Becauſe theſe Churches did conſiſt of perſons truely good ſo far as men could judge (which is the only thing you can alledge from what is ſaid in the Epiſtles to them, and yet proves not) therefore they ſhould conſiſt of ſuch only, and no other, will not follow. 2. You whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſe your Argument taken from them again if you grant but that <hi>de facto</hi> there were other perſons in them then truely godly as far as men could judge, at that time when the Epiſtles were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to them. For unleſſe you aſſert that at that time they were conſtitute of perſons all ſuch, you alledge the Epiſtles to no purpoſe, becauſe the Epiſtles ſpeaks to them with relation to that very time they were written in. 3. It is raſhlie and inconſideratlie ſaid by Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> without exception, limitation, or qualification, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially he being now ſpeaking of maters of Religion) <hi>à facto ad jus non valet Argumentum,</hi> why, then let all Arguments which Orthodox Writers have brought from the practice of the Apoſtles and Primitive Churches regiſtrate in Scripture to prove they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106774:47"/> ought <hi>de jure</hi> ſo to do, as in the mater of ſanctifying the firſt day of the Week as the Chriſtian Sabbath, and many others in other matters, be caſten as null. If Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſay this, he ſhall gratifie much the Papiſts for their Doctrine of the neceſſity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written traditions; but ſhall be diſclaimed in this by all Proteſtant Divines, who give us ſundry caſes in matters of Religion, wherein it is good and ſolide reaſoning from facts and practiſes regiſtrate in Scripture, to duty; ſo ſuch perſons did, and therefore ſo ought we to do; eſpecially in matters of Church Government hath this way of reaſoning place; the Lord having left many things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, only in examples of practiſes (let the Reader ſee concerning this purpoſe the Authors of <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) from which we are to gather and take our rule: Now amongſt other rules belonging to this head, this certainly is one, what was the practice of Primitive Churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in Scripture, in maters of Religion, of common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Churches in all ages, and is not diſſallowed nor diſſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven in them, eſpecially when many other things are reproved in them, nor is againſt a generall precept otherwhere in Scripture; ſuch a practice hath the force of a rule; and we may well reaſon <hi>ab hoc facto ad jus.</hi> See <hi>Perkins, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>pag.</hi> in <hi>fol.</hi> 29. <hi>col.</hi> 1. <hi>A,</hi> ſo they did, therefore ſo may we lawfully. But I aſſume, theſe Primitive Churches, admitted and retained mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, all of which were not truely Godly and Saints as far as men could judge, and were not reproved for this, even when they were reproved for other things done by them; Nor can their be a generall precept ſhewn in the word contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. 4. What may ſeem to be alledged by him from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. as containing ſuch a generall precept, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcuſſed before. The intention and ſcope of that place is not to hold forth a rule concerning the ordering of the conſtitution of the Church, but to foretell an event that was to come to paſſe upon the Church in time of Antichriſts prevalencie; that <hi>which is without</hi> ſignifieth not perſons, but the face &amp; outward ſtate of the Viſible Church, and <hi>caſting out</hi> is not un-Churching of perſons, but judicial giving up the outward ſtate of the Viſible Church to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and his followers, and by <hi>meaſuring</hi> there is not meant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106774:48"/> of the conſtitution of a Society, but a typicall predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtraitneſſe that Orthodox and Godly Worſhippers were to be at that time redacted unto. 5. But what meaneth Mr. <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier,</hi> when being about to infringe the objection brought againſt his induction of theſe Churches, (<hi>viz.</hi> that there were wicked perſons in them) and ſaying that becauſe bad men were in the Churches it doth not follow, therefore they ſhould be in them, he caſteth in that, <hi>the generall eſtate of which in ſuch a time of the World</hi> John <hi>ſpeaketh, Rev.</hi> 11. 1, 2. what meaneth he, I ſay, by ſuch a time of the World wherein the generall ſtate of the Churches were ſuch? if he mean that time wherein the Epiſtles were written to the Churches. 1. That paſſage of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is impertinently alledged; for, be the meaning of it what it will, it ſpeaks in relation to another time, long afterward to come. 2. It is certain 'tis the alledgeance in his own induction that theſe Epiſtles importe that then they were all conſtitute of true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good ones ſo far as men could judge, If he mean another time then that, he ſpeaks this as impertinently; for the objection ſpeaks of theſe Churches in relation to the time when the Epiſtles were written to them.</p>
                  <p>2ly. Saith he in his anſwer, <hi>Churches may be negligent, and not ſo ſtrict to their rule to examine and prove the grace of God in ſuch as offer to joyn themſelves, as the Church of Jeruſalem did, if Churches do not mind diligently their rule, they may have evil perſons among them enough, and yet not be able to maintain that it ſhould be ſo; 'tis like the Aſian Churches, and moſt of the firſt, quickly after the Apoſtles time grew faulty in this kind. Anſ.</hi> 1. Reader, ſee here pretty Logick: Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> in his induction undertook to prove and conclude a rule from the examples of theſe particular Churches, that becauſe theſe particular Churches were conſtitute of perſons truely good, therefore all Churches ought to be conſtitute only of ſuch perſons; it is objected, there were many other perſons then ſuch, in theſe Churches; and now he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Churches</hi> (he muſt apply it to theſe Churches, elſe he is <hi>extra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oleas</hi>) may be negligent and not ſo ſtrict to their rule; is not this a running in a round? Theſe Churches were conſtitute of ſuch members, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo ought all Churches generally to be, if they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106774:48"/> were conſtitute of any other, it was becauſe they were not ſtrict to their rule, <hi>i. e.</hi> in plain Language, becauſe they were not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute as Churches ought to be. 2. But let go this, and the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Argument; for it is clearly quite here, and refuge had to the generall rule. I ſay where is that rule of examining and proving the grace of God in ſuch as offer themſelves to joyn, that they were not ſo ſtrict to as they ſhould? And where have we an inſtance of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> greater ſtrictneſſe to that rule then theſe other Churches? Thus to ſet down naked aſſertions, is it not to deſpiſe hearers and Readers? 3. To what purpoſe do ye ſpeak of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and other firſt Churches their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice after the Apoſtles time? The objection ſpeaks of theſe Churches even as they were when the Apoſtles were living and did write to them theſe Epiſtles, out of which you labour to inſtruct your induction of them.</p>
                  <p>3ly. <hi>Or Churches</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though very diligent and duely ſtrict in this mater, yet are not infallible, and therefore hypocrits may deceive a Church for a time, and ſo get in where they have no right to be; the Apoſtle Jude doth confeſſe ſo much, v.</hi> 4. <hi>not only perſons may thus creep into the Church, but alſo into office, and ſtill eſcape the firſt judgement made upon them by the Churches of which they are. The Apoſtle doth intimate this to Timothy, lay hands ſuddenly on no man, and his charge on this may make a man tremble,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 21, 22. <hi>We are, as appears by this compared with other Scriptures, to uſe all care as much as in us lyeth, to prevent by the firſt judgement of the Church, all that are not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from coming to a ſtate to which they are not approved by God, but if men by ſubtilty creep in where they ſhould not be, they are to be caſt out by the after judgement of the Church, which is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, when it doth evidently appear that they are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, though not drunkards, and ſuch kind of bodily-ſinners, which is far leſſe ſimply conſidered then hypocriſie, which after-judgement is an Ordinance to cleanſe the houſe of God and keep it pure, And doth ſtrongly confirme the point I am on, that the mater of the Viſible Church ſhould be reall Saints. Anſ.</hi> 1. All this is juſt nothing to the purpoſe in hand. Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> to prove his generall Doctrine, that a Church Viſible ought to be conſtitute,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106774:49"/> in its matter, of ſuch as are truely Godly, at leaſt ſo far as men can judge, had undertaken to ſhew by induction, that theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches were conſtitute of perſons all ſuch. It was object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had in them ſome others. Now here he tells us in anſwer that Churches not being infallible may be deceived (and conſequently ſo might thir be) in taking in ſuch as ought not to be within. Once granting that it was ſo in theſe Churches, hes he not quite again his alledgeance concerning them in his inductive Argument; and taken him to the generall rule, which was the thing he undertook to prove, and but begs the thing in Queſtion? But to the mater in this branch of the Anſwer. Then, 2. When he ſaith hypocrites have no right to be in the Church, or, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſhould not be there, if the meaning were, that men, though they make a profeſſion of Religion, yet continuing hypocrites and graceleſſe in their hearts do ſin in adjoyning themſelves to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church and that they have no right <hi>in foro interiori</hi> this we ſhould not deny; but if his meaning be, that no hypocrits have a <hi>jus Eccleſiaſticum</hi> and <hi>in foro exteriori</hi> to be in the Viſible Church, we deny it, and he ſhall never be able to prove it. 3. 'Tis true that <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, that ſuch men creept in unawars into the fellowſhip of the Church, who afterward kythed to be ſuch, as I ſhall not deny, they ought to have been caſten out: But <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith not, that theſe when they made a Profeſſion of Religion, and did not vent ſuch abominations, had no <hi>jus Eccleſiaſticum</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Church into their fellowſhip. 4. All that Mr. <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier</hi> here bringeth in concerning admitting perſons into Offices in the Church is idly and impertinently alledged to the point in hand: We acknowledge that none ought to be put in ſuch Offices, but ſuch as give evidences of all manner of godly converſation; We have an expreſſe and full rule for this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And hands ought not to be laid upon any man, without a foregoing tryall and proofe of theſe things. But where will ye ſhew us in all the Scripture from the one end to the other ſuch a rule requiring ſuch qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in perſons, and ſuch a tryall of them before, and in relation to their admiſſion into the fellowſhip of the Viſible Church; And to be under Paſtorall care and the Miniſtry of the Word? If he could ſhew us this, either in precept or approved practice, we
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106774:49"/> ſhould ſoon yeeld, and be at an end of this controver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e; But this he cannot, nor ever will be able to ſhew; and therefore the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the care and acuracy to be uſed in trying perſons, who are already in the Church, in relation to admitting them to places of office, unto admiſſion of perſons into the ſociety of the Viſible Church, is unreaſonable. 5. When he ſaith that men are to be caſt out by Excommunication, when it doth evidently appear, that they are hypocrites, though not drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deſire, 1. That it may be obſerved that an hypocrite may be taken in a double ſenſe. Firſt, for ſuch an one as groſſely and knowingly counterfeits a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, and ſo indeed is nothing elſe but an hiſtrioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſtage-profeſſor; Secondly, more largly for any that hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, wherein, may be, he is morally ſerious, but hath not within a Principle of true, ſupernaturall, ſaving grace: Such are all unregenerate perſons in the Church, ſuch an one was that young Man in the Goſpel, whom our Lord is ſaid to have loved, and the Lawyer of whom he ſaid, thou art not far from the Kingdome of Heaven. Now if we ſpeak of hypocrites in the former ſenſe, if men appear to be ſuch, I ſhall confeſſe that if they have been within they are to be caſt out by Excommunication, yet in the order that Chriſt hath preſcribed, after due admonition and evidence of obſtinacy and incorrigibleneſſe in the evill, and of this I ſhall ſay more then Mr. <hi>Lockier, viz.</hi> that it is far greater, not only then drunkenneſſe, and other ſuch bodily ſins ſimplie <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re peccati</hi> in the nature of ſin; But, if it evidently appear, alſo <hi>in genere ſcandali</hi> in the nature of ſcandall (which is the ground and conſideration upon which cenſure proceedeth,) becauſe it is a very mocking of God in the higheſt degree: But if we ſpeak of hypocrites in the latter ſenſe; We deny utterly that every man appearing to be ſuch is to be Excommunicated and caſten out of the Societie of the Viſible Church. If a man profeſſe ſeriouſlie Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſubmitting himſelf to Ordinances, though there were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yea though it were revealed by God, that yet he were not Regenerate, -and indued with true ſupernaturall Grace, I ſay ſuch an one were not to be excommunicate; Let Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> or any for him, ſhew a warrand of Scripture for Excommunicating a man for non-regeneration. The Doctrine of all Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106774:50"/> hither till, concerning the object of Excommunication, and that grounded upon the Word of God, is that which is ſhortly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Learned and Reverend Profeſſours of <hi>Leyden Synop. pur. theol, Objectum circa quod exercetur haec Diſciplina Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtica ſunt illi qui fratres nominantur; cauſa verò eſt vita pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va vel Doctrina perverſa, nec ideo ſtatim, ubi quis frater nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in hujuſmodi ſcandala incidit, a corpore Eccleſiae excludi debet, quemadmodum quibuſdam Anabaptiſtis in uſu eſt: Sed poſt privatas demum, &amp; publicas Eccleſiae admonitiones contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas &amp; rejectas, ſicuti Chriſti verba aperte ſignificant, Mat.</hi> 18.] <hi>diſp.</hi> 48. <hi>theſ.</hi> 25, 26. And though drunkenneſſe and ſuch like bodily-ſins be leſſe then hypocriſie in this ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> non-regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſimply, and <hi>in genere peccati</hi> in the nature of ſin, yet it is not leſſe <hi>in genere ſcandali,</hi> in the kind of ſcandall and offence unto the Church: Nay this hath not the nature of ſcandall at all. 6. Yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> according to the genius of his Doctrine ought to ſay not only men, <hi>when it doth evidently appear that they are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits,</hi> but even if it <hi>doth not evidently appear</hi> that they are truly gracious, and we cannot diſcern in them the power of godlineſſe, they are to be Excommunicate: For his Doctrine is that none are fit mater to be admitted or permitted to conſtitute a Viſible Church, but ſuch as are truely Godly ſo far as men truely Godly can judge and diſcern. I beleeve moſt of the Independent way will diſclaime him in this. 7. Excommunication is an Ordinance to keep the houſe of God pure and according to what it ought to be, <hi>in point of duety, in foro exteriori,</hi> and in order to ſalvation, this we grant, only in this ſenſe, that it is an Ordinance tending towards this as a means, (for this is an end of Excommunication <hi>that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus</hi>) but not in this ſenſe that the Church is obliged thereby to effectuate it <hi>quoad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum,</hi> this belongeth to God alone. Excommunication is an Ordinance to keep the Church pure and according to what it ought to be, <hi>in point of qualification in foro exteriori,</hi> in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Viſible Church-ſtate, even <hi>quoad eventum;</hi> But now what this qualification <hi>in foro exteriori</hi> in order to Church-ſtate is, is the thing in Queſtion. So Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> in his reaſoning from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication to his Doctrine, either alledgeth nothing to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106774:50"/> purpoſe, taking his antecedent in the former ſenſe; or begs the Queſtion, taking it in the latter. 8. In the concluſion as propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here: Firſt note, If only reall Saints be the proper mater of a Viſible Church, and ſaving grace the complexion of it; then all Saints ſo far as men can judge, are not fit mater; for theſe are not neceſſarily reall Saints, ſimply. 2. When as he ſaith, <hi>not one known to be otherwiſe,</hi> he ſhould have ſaid anſwerably to the former words, no not one, not known, ſo far as men can judge, to be ſuch. 3. <hi>[Can juſtifiably enter]</hi> may be conceived, either in point of duty incumbent to themſelves who enter, and ſo the meaning is this, men joyning themſelves to the Viſible Church and making profeſſion of Religion, without true faith and repentance, are not juſtifiable in this before God; or it may be conceived to be ſpoken of the Churches active admiſſion of men into externall Church-communion, and the ſenſe is this, it is not juſtifiable that men not having ſaving grace ſhould by the Church be admitted to enter into the fellowſhip of the Viſible Church: If in any thing, certainly in propounding Doctrines, ſtating controverſies, forming concluſions, ambiguities ſhould be ſhun'd. We grant the former ſenſe, but the latter we deny; and it is not yet proven. This much of the inducti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If it prove any thing, it proveth not only, that <hi>de jure</hi> the Viſible Church ought to be conſtitute of materials or members, truely endued with ſaving grace and faith; but alſo it is no true Viſible Church which doth not <hi>de facto</hi> conſiſt of materials all ſuch, <hi>i. e.</hi> truely <hi>in veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate rei</hi> endued with true ſaving grace and faith, and then likely there was never in the world a true Viſible Chriſtian Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it was that of the eleven after that <hi>Judas</hi> hanged himſelf, or may be that <hi>Acts</hi> 1. nor ever ſhall be in the world.

'Tis grounded upon a meer miſtake or falſe ſuppoſition that the building built upon Chriſt as a Rock and foundation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20, 21. is the Viſible Church as ſuch: Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſaith well, that it is confeſſed on all hands, that Chriſt is the Rock and foundation ſtone; but he could not ſay it is agreed upon by all that the Church Viſible is the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that is ſaid to be built upon that foundation growing up into a holy Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Papiſts indeed ſay it is the Viſible Church,

Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſhould have proven, and not meerly taken for granted, that the Viſible Church is the building built upon Chriſt as the foundation-ſtone, ſeeing he knew that it was denyed generally by Proteſtant Divines. The Viſible Church, according to its viſible ſtate is not the building, but the work houſe wherein the ſtones are fitted for to be laid in the building and built up. 3. Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſuppoſeth in this Argument that the Viſible Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> a particular Independent Congregation muſt be a ſtanding faſt, laſting houſe, <hi>quae non deficiat,</hi> which is not to fail, and that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity is the priviledge and property of it, in this alſo joyning with Papiſts, againſt whom all Proteſtant Divines maintain that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to the Church of the elect, or if to the Church Viſible, not to any particular, but to the univerſall. We grant then that any Church Viſible is defectible and may indeed fall, and that even upon that ground amongſt others that there is not an uniformity and homogeneouſneſſe amongſt all parts of it, ſome are of the ſeed of the Woman, really good; ſome be, at the beſt, ſeemingly good, and really bad, and the ſeed of the Serpent (and Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> way will not make it to be otherwayes) and we confeſſe that it is by the finger of God, that any Church is any long ſpace kept ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: Yet God will keep Viſible Churches ſtanding, for all the aſymmetry and heterogeneouſneſſe of members amongſt themſelves (as to their inward, ſpirituall, eternall ſtate) ſo long as he has a work for gathering and building up his elect amongſt them, for whoſe ſake it is that a Viſible Church and his Ordinances therein are ſet up. You will ſay, but doth not God this by means? <hi>Anſ:</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106774:52"/> yea verily he uſeth means which he bleſſeth and maketh effectuall for that end, to the keeping down of the evills that are in many and would be ready to break out to the undoeing of all, as long as he ſees meet; as the Preaching of the Word, exerciſe of Diſcipline againſt ſcandals; but God never preſcribed this as a means for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Viſible Churches that no perſons ſhould be admitted or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be in the Viſible Church, but ſuch as are ſymmetricall and homogeneall in true ſaving grace.

Anſ.</hi> 1. I profeſſe I cannot forbear to ſay that I find Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> abuſe much Scripture in the little bounds of this Peece, by moſt impertinent Citations. What is there in this place to the purpoſe of the conſtitution of the Viſible Church as to its matter or Members? the Apoſtle here <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. is ſpeaking of Doctrines fundamentall and ſuperſtructed, and that theſe ought to be ſuitable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that, what is this to the mater of the Viſible Church? Ay, Yes, <hi>by Analogie</hi> would he ſay firſt, becauſe the Apoſtle uſeth the ſame <hi>medium</hi> and argues as I do, that if Chriſt be layed as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>&amp;c. Anſ.</hi> And muſt that hold Univerſallie? becauſe one uſing a <hi>medium</hi> in one mater reaſons truelie and ſolidlie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another uſing that <hi>medium</hi> in another mater and reaſoning
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106774:52"/> that ſame way for forme, muſt alſo reaſon truelie and ſolidelie? What if this other erre in the application of the <hi>medium,</hi> and if ſome of his premiſſes and principles, whereof his argument conſiſts, be falſe upon the matter? ſo it is here: The Apoſtle reaſoneth well and concludently upon that principle, that the ſuperſtructure ſhould be ſuitable to the foundation that Teachers ſhould take heed what Doctrines they teach in the Church; Becauſe he aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well that Chriſt or the Doctrine of Chriſt is the foundation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point of Doctrine in Religion, and all other Doctrines are the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures; But Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> aſſumeth amiſſe that the Viſible Church as ſuch, is the ſuperſtructure built upon Chriſt as the Foundation. The Scripture ſayeth no where ſo, a Viſible Church-ſtate, or to be received unto, or to be in the Viſible Church ſtate, is not to be built on Chriſt as a Foundation, but is to be taken in under, or to be under the means of being built, either firſt or in a further degree of advancement, on Chriſt as a Foundation. But further (ſayeth he) <hi>ſee how he applyes this,</hi> ver. 16, 17. <hi>incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſuperſtructions, if in point of Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is ſomewhat ſpoken in the miſt, but for ought I can conjecture or conceive, the meaning ſeemeth to be this; that wrong Doctrines taught in the Church makes perſons unholy, and ſo unfit mater for the Church to conſiſt of; and ſo deſtroyes or defiles the Temple of God, which is, as he conceiveth, the Viſible Church. And thus he will have the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. to apply that which he had been ſpeaking in the preceeding verſes. Now if this be not a forceing of the purpoſe and meaning of theſe two verſes, let any underſtanding man in the Chriſtian World judge. The plain, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine intention and purpoſe of the Apoſtle in theſe verſes is, to warne and dehort the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from defiling and laying waſte the Church, either by corrupt, idle, or curious Doctrine not ſuitable to the foundation Chriſt; or by Schiſmaticall addicting themſelves to this or that man who were teachers among them (which was the purpoſe whereupon he began this diſcourſe, <hi>v.</hi> 4.) or both; and that upon theſe three grounds. 1. The conſideration of the dignity they were advanced to, that they were the Temple of God, conſecrated by the indwelling Spirit to him. 2. That ſuch things did defile, and lay them waſte. 3. That God would
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106774:53"/> ſeverly puniſh ſuch as any wayes defiled and deſtroyed them that were a Temple conſecrated to him. Ay but, 3.

Mr. <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier</hi> then conceiveth that theſe words are brought in as a reaſon why he that teacheth wrong or incongruous Doctrines defiles or deſtroyes the Temple of God: To this ſenſe, the Viſible Church conſiſts of ſuch as are holy, and hes the Spirit dwelling in them and none elſe, therefore men by teaching incongruous Doctrine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men in the Church incongruous mater, <hi>i. e.</hi> unholy, deſtroyes the Temple, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Viſible Church. A meer forgerie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to clear ſhining evidence of the Apoſtles context, wherein any man that is not blind may ſee that theſe words <hi>for the Temple of God is holy,</hi> are given as a reaſon why theſe that defile the Temple will be ſeverly puniſhed of God; the reaſon of which conſequence clearly intimate in the words is, becauſe God will not indure the defiling or violating of that which is holy and conſecrate to himſelf. 2. True indeed, ſuch are the Temple of God which are holy and none elſe? So Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſuppoſeth, but without reaſon or proof.

                  <p>In the end of this paragraph he prompts us another Argument equivalent to this firſt, from this that Chriſt is called the Head, and the Church the Body: In form it muſt ſtand thus: If Chriſt be the Head, there muſt be an homogenealneſſe in the Church to him,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106774:53"/> he meaneth they muſt be truely gracious, and endued with true ſaving faith; But Chriſt is the Head, and the Viſible Church his Body. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon of the connexion of the firſt Propoſition is, becauſe elſe there can be no mutuall derivation from one to another. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Proteſtant Divines will with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deny your aſſumption as Popiſh, and tell you that it is the Church of the Elect that is the Body of Chriſt the Head. See but <hi>Whittaker de Eccleſ. q,</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>pag.</hi> 449. in <hi>fol.</hi> Yet. 2. For more clear and particular anſwer we are to conſider, that Chriſt may be ſaid to be the Head, and the Church his body, either in a <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſenſe,</hi> as a King is called the Head of the Common-wealth, and the People are called his Body: Or (to ſpeak ſo) in a <hi>phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe</hi> according to the ſimilitude of mans body. Now we grant that Chriſt is a Head to the Viſible Church, and the Viſible Church hath unto him the relation of a body in the former ſenſe, Chriſt is a King of the Viſible Church, and the Viſible Church is his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Body: But hence it followeth not that there muſt be ſuch a homogenealneſſe in the Church Viſible as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> meaneth, that it be endued with true faith and have the Spirit dwelling in their hearts. And as to the reaſon of the connexion of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, we anſwer, ſuch a homogenealneſſe is not requiſite for ſuch a derivation, as is from a head politicall to its politicall body; this derivation being only morall, by commands, prohibitions and the like morall actings. But Chriſt is not a Head in the latter ſenſe, (as the head in the naturall body is) to the Church Viſible as ſuch; nor is the Viſible Church a body to him in this ſenſe, but only <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione activâ</hi> and in externall profeſſion: Neither is that deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chriſt unto the Church, whereby it groweth up in the Lord, unto the Church as a Viſible Church, or conſidered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its viſible conſtitution; But unto the Church Inviſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, Myſticall as ſuch.</p>

Anſ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſtill in this, as in all his other Arguments, ſhews that in propounding his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he added that qualification, <hi>truely gracious ſo far as men can judge,</hi> but <hi>dicis cauſa,</hi> and in ſhew, to avoid for a while the <hi>odium</hi> of the greateſt Anabaptiſts Tenent of the mater or members of the Viſible Church. For ſuch as may be gracious and Godly ſo far as men can judge, mens judgement being not infallible in this (as himſelf confeſſeth) may be deſtitute of the power of Godlines in their hearts, and ſo ſuch as will not hold out truth firmly in the midſt of all trials, may be but dead perſons, and ſo ſuch as in whom God doth not live, walk and dwell. 2. As to that firſt property and character attributed to a Viſible Church from, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. by Mr. <hi>Lockier:</hi> Firſt, I would aske him if in good earneſt he meaneth that to be a property of a Viſible Church rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in its mater, as it ſhould be, that it will bear up the truth and things of God firmly and faithfully to the world in the midſt of all trials? Sure, this is the very thing that Papiſts alledge from this place for the unerrabilitie and indefectibilitie of the Viſible Church againſt which all Proteſtant Divines diſputes. Yea it is much more, for Papiſts attribute this only to the Catholick Church Viſible, acknowledging that all particular Viſible Churches may erre and make defection, and let the truth and things of God fall down; excepting only the Roman Church, becauſe they make it to be the Catholick Church virtually: but Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> acknowledges no Church Viſible, but an Independent Congregation, and will have this to be the property of any particular Viſible Church, and therefore propounds the ſubject of his concluſion here thus, <hi>a Church Viſible, i. e.</hi> any Viſible Church; now let me put him further to it; either there was never a Church Viſible rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for mater from the beginning, ſeeing all the firſt conſtitute
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106774:54"/> Churches have made defection and let truth fall down, which if he ſay, beſides that it is abſurd in it ſelf, I ask why then did he a little before bring us paterns of right conſtitute Churches from theſe firſt mentioned in Scripture? Or if they were right conſtitute, how comes it that they made defection and did not bear up and hold out the truth and things of God, but did let them fall? If he anſwer, that came to paſſe, becauſe they kept not a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for their mater. I repone, that taks not away the force of the Queſtion, For that ſame if it was ſo was a not bearing up and holding out firmly and faithfully the things of God, and ſo the Queſtion returneth upon this. 2. But to anſwer directly to the place; though Interpreters have ſome variety amongſt themſelves about the meaning of it: Yet never one of them acknowledges that Interpretation which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> gives, but oppoſeth it, and refuteth it in Papiſts: Some indeed expone the attribute <hi>the pillar and ground of truth</hi> much as he doth; but theſe by the Church to which it is attributed, und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106774:55"/> truely godly ſo far as men can judge are to be acknowledged and admitted as mater of a Viſible Church; now many of theſe may be, and undoubtedly are really impure and unbeleeving, and ſo of neceſſity muſt their offering be impure. If it be ſaid, yet it is not the fault of the admitters that they do ſo. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That's nothing to the purpoſe, for whether they be faulty or not, ſtill it ſtandeth good, that by that way it cannot be avoyded but impure and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving will be in the Viſible Church, ſuch as cannot offer a pure offering. 2. It reproacheth the diſpenſation and wiſdome of the bleſſed Lord God himſelf, becauſe he hes not left in his Word a rule and way whereby the Church Viſible may be conſtitute ſo as that Propheſie and his decree revealed therein concerning his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice among the Gentiles may be fulfilled, for he hes given no rule whereby the Church Viſible may be gotten ſo conſtitute as that all the mater thereof ſhall be perſons truely Godly; But there may be and cannot but be, in it many impure and unbeleeving who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not offer a pure offering. But 3. To anſwer directly, we deny the connexion or conſequence of the firſt propoſition; 'tis groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a falſe ſuppoſition, that there can be no pure offering in the Church, unleſſe all the mater, that is, members of the Viſible Church, be truly godly. What? may there not be a pure offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to God in the Church, and ſo that Propheſie be fulfilled of the Churches of the Gentiles, if ſome in the Churches Viſible be truely Godly, though all be not ſuch? Therefore he takes paines without neceſſity to prove that impure and unbeleevers cannot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a pure offering; that we grant (I mean not this materially and objectively, for ſo an impure man may offer a pure offering) he ſhould have proven to make his conſequence good, that if all the mater be not ſuch as cannot offer a pure offering there can be no pure offering in the Church at all. If Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſay here, that not only the offering of the unbeleeving and impure themſelves, but alſo the offering of all that are in the Viſible Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, is impure; This is plain and down right Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and is diſclaimed of all the pious and learned amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, at leaſt <hi>in dogmate,</hi> and is moſt contrary to the Word of God.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106774:56"/> as are all truely Godly; But the former is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. and if thus, then we deny the connexion or conſequence of the firſt Propoſition; And my reaſon, for the denyall thereof is this: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I may ſay, if the Churches Viſible be <hi>de facto</hi> ſuch that all or moſt part of their Members be truely Godly, and ſhining in the Power of Godlineſſe, at the time wherein God hath decreed to bring in the Jews, that will be ſufficient for provoking the Jews, although it be not conſtitute by a Rule or Precept that the Church in admitting Members into externall Church-fellowſhip, admit none but thoſe that are truely Godly. And why may we not ſay, that the Lord will at ſome time, for carrying on a deſign decreed by himſelf in the way of the diſpenſation of his efficacious Grace, make his Viſible Church, at leaſt in moſt part, the Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, better as to the reality and Power of Religion, then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to be by way of Rule, relating to Eccleſiaſtick procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Perſons in admiting them to externall Viſible Church-communion. In a word, the futurition of the provocation of the Jews by the Power of Godlineſſe in Gentile Profeſſours, proveth only, that God is to make the Gentile Profeſſours ſuch <hi>de facto,</hi> or at moſt, what they ought to be in point of their duty, for ſerving and glorifying God: But proves not that they ought to be ſuch in point of qualification <hi>in foro exteriori Eccleſiae</hi> and in relation to admiſſion to the externall ſociety of the Viſible Church.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>11</label> Or, Secondly, It may be formed thus; If the Jews ſhall be provoked to turn unto the Lord, and imbrace Chriſtian Religion, by the glory and purity of his Worſhip and Worſhippers, then the Viſible Church or Churches (uſe which ye will now) ſhall be conſtitute or conſiſt of ſuch as are truely Godly: But the former is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the latter alſo. And I anſwer: 1. Suppoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent be granted in as large an univerſality as it can be taken in: Yet it ſpeaks nothing to the Queſtion in hand. Why? Becauſe only of what is to be <hi>de facto &amp; quoad eventum,</hi> by diſpenſation of effectuall Grace in the Viſible Church; And not what ought to be; by rule, of neceſſity, that the Church Viſible may be rightly conſtitute in its Viſible Church-ſtate; and the Queſtion is about this latter, not that former; And diſpenſations of effectuall Grace are not our rule in this. 2. Nor yet doth it follow of neceſſity,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106774:57"/> that even <hi>de facto</hi> the Church Viſible ſhall be ſo conſtitute, as to its matter in every difference of time, but only that it ſhall be at that time that the Jews are to be brought in and converted to the Chriſtian Faith. Yea, nor doeth it follow that <hi>de facto</hi> even at that time the Church Viſible ſhall be ſo conſtitute in its mater, that all and every Member thereof ſhall be truely Godly and ſhining in the manifeſtations of Purity and the Power of Godlineſſe; but that ſo it ſhall be for the moſt part, and commonly in the Viſible Church. I acknowledge that a means of awaking up the Jews to come unto, and imbrace the Chriſtian Religion, will be a more glorious &amp; full Reformation of Chriſtians, both in point of Worſhip and in point of converſation: Now Superſtition and Antichriſtian Idolatry amongſt thoſe that are called Chriſtians (which are theſe they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee for the moſt part) is a ſtumbling block to them that ly in their way at this day, and I will not ſay, but the impurity and unrighteouſneſſe of Chriſtians is alſo a ſtumbling block to them; Albeit I think they do not ſo much ſtumble at this as at the former, conſidering that, which is well known in the places where they live, how much notour and known unrighteouſneſſe is amongſt them generally, being for the moſt part moſt covetous, exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant uſurers, cheaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> moſt evidently, the deadeſt, formall, ſlight in performance of their way of Worſhip (as mine eyes have been witneſſes) of any people in the World. Yet I ſay, I will not deny that this may ſtumble them, and they, may be, do pretend it alſo; Therefore <hi>Babylon</hi> the Mother of fornications muſt, and will down; And the Princes of the earth that have given up their power to that Whoore, will hate her &amp; burn her fleſh with fire; and the Lord will purge and reforme his Worſhip, and Ordinances, and the Chriſtian World from Superſtition and Idolatry: And I believe alſo that their is a time coming when there ſhall be alſo a more general and ſhining Reformation of the lives of Chriſtians; &amp; that both theſe ſhall concur as means to provock the Jews to fall in love with the Chriſtian Religion, and to ſeek unto Jeſus Chriſt; But that all and every Profeſſour in the Viſible Church ſhall be truely Godly, or ſhining ſo gloriouſly in the Power of Godlineſſe (for indeed it is not Godlineſſe ſimply ſo much, as a more then

Now here, 1. One point of vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lence done to the Text, (the clear diſcovery to every body likely he hes ſhun'd by not explaining what he underſtood by that glory of God) for by the glory of God here, I think no Chriſtian Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will underſtand any other thing, but the true knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt declared by the Preaching of the Goſpel, that ſame which the Apoſtle meaneth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.—the glory of the Lord beheld with open face as in a glaſſe, viz.</hi> in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>hath ſhined in our hearts to give the light of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt.</hi> If he ſay he meaneth the ſame, then I ſay he paſſes from the purpoſe of his Argument, for clearing of which he brought in this. 2.

By theſe Brethren who are ſaid to be brought in, cannot be underſtood Jews (I mean as the name of Jews is now taken under the New Teſt. as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that are remaining of the ancient people profeſſing the Jewiſh Religion, whether of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> or of other Tribes) my reaſon, from the Text, is this, becauſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. its ſet down as a new and unuſuall priviledge and dignity vouchſafed upon theſe Brethren brought, that God would alſo take of them Prieſts and Levits, <hi>i. e.</hi> Miniſters to officiat in his Worſhip and Ordinances. Now it can be no new &amp; unuſuall thing to take of Jews to be ſuch: for it had been alwayes ſo; therefore we do conceive, with theſe Learned Interpretets we named and others, by theſe Brethren, muſt be meant Gentiles who are called the Jews Brethren becauſe when now brought in by the Goſpel, in regard of faith, they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and Gods Children, yea and are called Gods Children, even while yet not actually called, <hi>viz.</hi> in the decree and purpoſe of God, <hi>John</hi> 11. 52.

And theſe Brethren to be brought in out of all Nations are all one and the ſame. 4. Theſe ſpoken of, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>I will ſet a ſigne among them, and ſend theſe that eſcape among them,</hi> are not of the Gentiles. 1. For that which we ſaid of theſe Brethren that are brought in by them. If theſe Brethren be the Gentiles, theſe ſent out to bring them in muſt be Jews. 2. Clearly, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. theſe ſent forth are diſtinguiſhed from the Gentiles, even the whole univerſality of the Gentiles, which are ſet down, 1. Generally <hi>unto the Nations,</hi> then by a particular enumeration or diſtribution of them according to the ſeverall quarters of the World, Eaſt, Weſt, South and North, Iles and Continent.

Wherein all of the Nation are bound to a publick and ſolemn typicall ſervice and Worſhip to be performed in one place choſen by God, under the inſpection of one Viſible Paſtor or Prieſt who in Worſhip and Sacrifices doth hold forth and repreſent the whole People of the Nation. 2. Such a Nationall and Provinciall Church, in which many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches are united and ſubjected unto one Church (as they call it, Mother or Cathedrall Church) and depend upon a Viſible Paſtor; who is Paſtor and Ruler of all other Paſtors and particular Churches in the Nation or Province; And wherein the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106774:63"/> Inferiour Churches enjoy Divine Ordinances and Eccleſiaſticall power and juriſdiction, of that Mother and Cathedrall Church or that Provinciall or Nationall Paſtor. 3. Such a Nationall Church wherein many particular Churches are joyned and united together under one Viſible Church-Government) wherein all are equally and collaterally concerned; and have equall intereſt for the uſe and exerciſe of all theſe Ordinances, which are neceſſary to the Viſible Miniſteriall Government of theſe Churches, and mutuall Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall fellowſhip in it, and edification and preſervation by it. Now a Nationall Church in the ſecond notion is not, nor ever was an Ordinance of God, but a meer invention of men and Antichriſtian tyrannie, overthrowing the power granted by GOD to the Churches, and Paſtors. A nationall Church of the firſt notion and ſenſe was indeed an Ordinance of God.

Let Mr. <hi>Lookier</hi> ſhew me a Text in the whole New Teſtament importing an abrogation of it; Nay, we truſt through the Lords grace, ere we come to an end, to give evidence from the Word of God that there is a Church Viſible under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a larger extent and bounds (I mean in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) then a Province or Nation, even a Viſible Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. Therefore I conclude that we maintaining a Nationall Church in no other ſenſe then this, which is ſtill warranted and allowed in the New Teſtament, it is nothing elſe but groſſe Separatiſme to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106774:64"/> gather Churches out of Churches upon this account, becauſe they are united into one Nationall Church in this ſenſe. As to that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> of gathering Churches out of that one Church of the Jews which he would confirm by <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 22. I <hi>Anſ.</hi> The alledgeance is groſſely impertinent; for why? We are now upon the practice of gathering and conſtituting Churches in a new Viſible Church-ſtate, of perſons withdrawn from Churches wherein is the ſound Doctrine of the faith of Chriſt and pure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments according to their inſtitution (ſuch as the moſt judicious and Godly amongſt the Independent Brethren themſelves confeſſe to be true Churches) upon this account, becauſe they are united into one Nationall Church in point of Government. But now will Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſay, that the Chriſtian Churches of the Jews were gathered out of the Jews, upon this account, becauſe they were a Nationall Church in this ſenſe? He cannot upon any warrand in the world. The ground of their gathering out from the reſt of the Jews, was becauſe the reſt would not beleeve Jeſus to be the Meſſiah, nor imbrace him as their Saviour: But would ſtill adhere to their ceremoniall Worſhip, Sacrifices and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and would be ſaved by their own righteouſneſſe, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Chriſt and his Doctrine.</p>

I think no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding adverſary, would have moved this as an objection againſt his Doctrine, handled in this Lecture concerning the matter of the Viſible Church. But I think indeed, being well managed, it may be made uſe of to good purpoſe againſt their Independent Churches in point of their Government, thus, The Government that is apt to open a door to Errors, ſeemeth, cannot be of God. But ſuch is the Independent way of Church Government; Which makes every particular Congregation Independent, and ſupreme in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo that if any of them fall into Error, there is no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Power on earth, that authoritatively can interpoſe to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106774:64"/> redreſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein they go wrong. And certaine it is by this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, many Errours have ſprung up amongſt them that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this way. And for this very cauſe it is, that ſo many maintainers of groſſe Errours, as Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lay hold on this way of Government, as moſt ſuitable to their deſignes, and ſerviceable for their ſafetie and indemnitie. And here I ſhall deſire M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> to remember, how that Reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> parallelling the Churches of <hi>Geneva, France, Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> put the ſpeciall point of their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the nature and way of their Government, <hi>viz.</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall, whereby they have more then any Reformed Churches, preſerved themſelves, in Unity and Truth, free of Schiſmes and Hereſies. But we will have place afterward to ſpeak of this point of Government.

When this New Heaven, as the Prophet calleth it, this new order was firſt ſet up at Jeruſalem, what bloody ſtirres made it there? When firſt at Antioch what work made it there?

Much miſtaking hes been diſcovered already in this Lecture of Mr. <hi>Lockiers,</hi> but in no one paſſage hath he worſe acquyted himſelf then in this we have now in hand. 1. True, it is no good Argument or prejudice either, againſt a Tenet or point of Doctrine that many take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thence to ſcoffe and break forth into much wickedeeſſe: But
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106774:66"/> this is not to the purpoſe in hand. Our alledgeance is that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent way of Church-Government is ſuch in the nature of it as giveth occaſion to men to run freely without controlement into errours, and is a kinde of ſhelter, for ſuch as holds and maintains er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, to run to, as experience proveth; and this, ſure, if it be not an intrinſick Argument yet it is a ſtrong preſumption againſt a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, that it is not of God, the like cannot be ſaid of the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian way. 2. As to the two inſtances brought in. They are as impertinent as the former generall; For neither by the Doctrine of the Trinity was <hi>occaſion given</hi> any wayes to the <hi>Arian</hi> hereſie. But the Devill raiſed up <hi>Arius</hi> and his hereſie, <hi>to oppoſe and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> that fundamentall point of Chriſtianity. Nor was there, by the Doctrine of Juſtification cleared by theſe modern fathers, <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given</hi> to the ſtirres of Anabaptiſts: But theſe were raiſed by the Devill <hi>in oppoſition againſt</hi> that and other points of Religion then cleared. I humbly conceive it agrees not well with Hiſtorie to ſay that upon <hi>the fathers beginning again</hi> to lay that principall fundamentall of the Trinity; the Devill did ſet on foot the <hi>Arian</hi> hereſie: The Hiſtory of theſe times ſeemeth to ſay that the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on foot the <hi>Arian</hi> hereſie gave occaſion to theſe ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to eſtabliſh and confirm from the Word of God that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and fundamentall of the Trinity. 3. While as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> (by way of application of theſe things noted on before) firſt ſayeth, <hi>now in this period of time God hath made another acceſſion of light, reſpecting the roofe and upper part of the houſe</hi> (meaning his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent way of Church conſtitution and Government) and then ſubjoyneth by way of Queſtion, <hi>and now what ſturres, &amp;c?</hi> Why, what now? <hi>Is all therefore—</hi>he but miſerably begs his Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> that his way is a new acceſſion of light. 4. Worſt of all doth he plead for his own cauſe in relation to the former Objection when as he alledgeth <hi>that it may rather be thought a way that hath ſomething of God in it, which the Devill oppoſeth, then to conclude to the contrary becauſe the Devill doth not uſually ſet againſt his own;</hi> Why? The Independent way is that which this day all the emiſſaries of Satan (I mean not meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Tell me Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> what condition were you in and would been in to this day, in all humane appearance, had not Presbyterians begun to draw the ſword in that quarrell? Tell me what was the means under God that procured liberty for the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of a free Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> 1640? Belike you think it was a crime, that you got not leave to crouch under the burden, and Religion, and Liberties were not ſuffered, for Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, to ly ſtill under oppreſſion and uſurpation. I believe the wiſeſt and moſt ingenuous, and thoſe that are moſt eminent amongſt them, that now are in power amongſt you and in theſe Lands, will not approve you in their judgement, for this challenge againſt us; And unleſſe I be miſinformed when they were come to this hight of prevalency, they are now in, and we brought to this low condition we are now continuing in, looking back, gave teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their acknowledgement, that our beginning to draw the ſword, did put the ſword in their hand, tho it was never our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to put it in their hand, for the effect, for which at laſt they have made uſe of it. 2.

Nor deny I but it belongs to the duty of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſeriouſly and attentively to obſerve with wiſdome, ſo far as he can, the way of ſuch as are under his charge, to diſcern and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſo far as may be, their ſpirituall condition and eſtate, and that he may have a probable judgement of diſcretion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, this is neceſſary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> behovefull for him, that he may rhe better know, how to perform that duty of dividing the Word of God aright. In effect it is no ſmall part of a Miniſters ſtudy to ſtudy the condition of his flock, yea, this in ſome way is incumbent to every particular Chriſtian in relation to others with whom they converſe, that they may be able the more accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datly and ptofitably to exhort and provoke one another to good works. But this I deny, that God has given to any man, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men, power and authority judicially to cognoſce upon the ſpirituall eſtate of every profeſſour of the Goſpel, and poſitively to pronounce every profeſſour of the Goſpel, upon ſuch cogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be held a regenerat man and in the eſtate of grace, or to be held unregenerat and yet in the ſtate of nature: Which yet Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> muſt needs force ſay by conſequence of his Docttine touching the qualification of Church mater or members. But now let him or any man ſhew me from the Word of God, any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Divine patent or commiſſion of this power, given to any man or ſociety of men in the world. The Lord has indeed given to the Church or rather to the Officers in the Church, a power au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively to cognoſce upon all profeſſours outward actions and to determine judicially whether ſinfull and ſcandalous, or not; but to cognoſce, determine and judge judicially and poſitively upon their inward Spirituall eſtate, we read not any where that he hath given power to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this he hath reſerved as a prerogative to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be exerciſed openly at laſt, in the day of Judgement, before all Men and Angells, and in this life ſecretly, by his Word and Spirit in the court of mens conſciences when it ſeems good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

If it had been our Lords will and inſtitution that true heart godlineſſe, converſion and faith, ſo far as men can diſcerne, ſhould be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualification to conſtitute perſons capable of Viſible-Church-Memberſhip, and conſequently had inſtituted a power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to cognoſce and paſſe judgement poſitively upon them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inward work of Grace in their heart, whither they be truely regenerate or not, that upon ſuch judgement, they might be admitted unto, or debarred from the fellowſhip of the Viſible Church: Then, ſure, he would given in his word a rule of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> tryall for regulating the Churches cognition, judgement and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this mater, expreſſing the particular characters and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences which being found in perſons they might be poſitively judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, regenerate and converted: Yea, and the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> that is, the loweſt degree and meaſure of ſuch characters, leſſe then which, if Profeſſours ſhould be found to have, they are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted non-regenerate, or at leaſt, not to be counted Regenerate. But there is no ſuch rule in the Word of God, therefore &amp;c. The connexion of the propoſition is certain and evident, and as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive cannot be denyed by any man. For firſt, it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived how it can conſiſt with the Wiſdome of God, that he would have ordained that only perſons ſo and ſo qualified ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the fellowſhip of the Church, and all others debarred: And that the Church ſhould have power to cognoſce; And poſitively to judge every profeſſour, that they are ſo qualified or not, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to admitting or excluding them; And yet not have preſcribed a definite rule for regulating the Churches cognition and judgement of rhis: But left it without rule to men in their conſciences, as both judge and rule, to determine who is to be held regenerate or not, certainly this cannot conſiſt with humane, let be divine, wiſedome: Alas! even gracious men being of very different and unequall ſyzes of light and diſcerning, could not but vary much one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106774:79"/> ſo that oftentimes their would be <hi>tot ſententiae quot capita.</hi> Then any man will readily vary from himſelf at diverſe times: Yea, the beſt of men are ſubject to ſinfull affections which may and would no doubt oftentimes by-aſſe the judgements, as having no ſmall influence thereupon: And ſo what confuſions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, yea and oftentimes grievous injuries to perſons in the mater of admiſſion into or excluſion from the fellowſhip of the Church, might not this open a door to, if the mater were committed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mans judgement without law or rule: Therefore it muſt be confeſſed, that there muſt be a rule for regulating the Churches cognition and judgement in this mater which the oppoſites will not deny. 2. This rule muſt be ſuch as holdeth forth not only the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular characters, upon the having or wanting of which the Church muſt cognoſce, and accordingly as is found to judge men Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or not: But alſo the very <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and meaſure whereupon the judgement of the Church is to proceed. My meaning, to ſpeak as plainly as I can to the weaker ſort is this: the rule muſt declare, how much is ſufficient and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at leaſt, to ground a poſitive judgement that a man is Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, of which if a man come ſhort, or have any wayes leſſe, he is to be reputed non-Regenerate, at leaſt not to be reputed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, which according to Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Doctrine debars him from being received as a Member of the Church. The reaſon of this is clear: becauſe otherwiſe the mater ſhould be left in a meer uncertaintie, and in effect devolved, upon the meer arbitrement of the Churches judgement: if, to wit, the rule ſhould ſay no more but <hi>indefinitely:</hi> a man, that he may be poſitively judged a true Regenerate Convert, muſt have ſome knowledge of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, experience of effectuall calling unto Faith and Repentance, and conformity of converſation to the Goſpel: Not determining definitely this or thus much at leaſt, he muſt have; which if he have, he is to be judged and reputed truely Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and if he come ſhort of this much, not.</p>

We deny not but there are ſome more eminent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works and actings of Religion and Piety, upon which men in whom they are ſeen, may be warrantably by others, ſo far as is competent to men, poſitively judged truely gracious: and that there are ſome outward works and actings of the fleſh deſigned by the Word of God ſo groſſe and corrupt (ſuch as are conſtant known neglect of the Worſhip of God, open contempt of Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, cuſtomarie mocking of Piety and Religion, and ſuch others, ſee 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4.) which appearing in men, others may eſteem them void of Grace, carnall, without the Spirit and fear of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things then being put out of controverſie, this is the thing we cannot ſee in the Word of God: a generall and univerſall rule for trying and giving judgement upon all and every Profeſſour in point of Regeneration and non-Regeneration, by others then themſelves: and holding forth ſuch definite limited and bounded Characters of Regeneration, whereupon others may paſſe a poſitive ſentence or judgement, <hi>viz.</hi> this man is to be held truely Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, becauſe he hath ſo much, or ſo much Profeſſion and practiſe: and this man is to be held not Regenerate, at leaſt, not to be held Regenerate, becauſe he hath not ſo much. I ſay we cannot ſee any rule of this kind, held forth in the Word of God: let Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> if he hath ſeen it, point us at it. Verily if he had had a mind to ſatisfie his readers and hearers, or done that which was requiſite to have been done by him in reaſon to ſatisfie and convince them of the doctrine he delivered touching the mater or Members of the Viſible Church, viz. <hi>that all and every one of them muſt be truely converted and ſealed of God for his, ſo far as men very ſpirituall can judge:</hi> he ſhould have told them and that from the Word of God, the particular definite bounded Characters whereby all and every Profeſſour may and are to be by others then themſelves

Is freedome from living in groſſe evills, or outward ſcandalls, ground ſufficient, with a profeſſion of the truth, for the Church to paſſe a poſitive ſentence or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that a man is regenerat and really in Chriſt? I think indeed it may be a ground, to keep us from poſitive judging the contrary of them, which in effect is nothing elſe, but to abſtract from poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judging of their inward ſpirituall condition at all. 3. If not living in the neglect of any known duty, <hi>i. e.</hi> living in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all known duty (or if he will, all known duties obvious to the notice of men) and not living in the commiſſion of any known evill, <hi>i. e.</hi> living in abſtinence from any known evill (or if he will, obvious to the notice of men) muſt be the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to proceed upon this judgement to be paſſed upon a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in relation to his admiſſion to the Viſible Church, and this <hi>living</hi> importeth a trade (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> exponeth) that is, a continued courſe: Then I would enquire how long time living ſo is ſufficient to ground the Eccleſiaſtick judgement, and leſſe then which will not ſerve the turn? This was neceſſary to have been determined that the rule might be certain, <hi>i. e.</hi> definite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, that the mater might not be devolved upon the arbitrement of mans judgement, or rather pleaſure. Here is <hi>altum ſilentium,</hi> and ſo again the mater left in the miſt. To preſſe this the more and the more clearly, I put the caſe the perſon deſiring to be admitted to the fellowſhip of the Church, and ſo to be judged of the Church, whether Regenerat or not, is one who has been an heathen, living before and till that very time in ſome known ſins (as many ſins are to heathen known ſins) of omiſſion and commiſſion. Now I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how long time muſt be taken to evidence him, not to be a liver in theſe known ſins, to the effect that a poſitive judgement may paſſe upon him that he is Regenerat? Let a poſitive Anſwer be given to this. If any ſhall ſay, a definite time is not neceſſary for trying ſuch an one, if he have Repentance for theſe ſins, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106774:82"/> as ſoon as he hath it, it is enough according to what Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>(converſatio abſque ſcandalo, paenitentiâ non ſanato.)</hi> then I ſay, Repentance here muſt be underſtood either as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the inward grace in the heart; but this falls not directly and immediatly under the cognition of the outward Court, to be a ground or <hi>medium</hi> of their procedour into judgement, yea it is the very thing, or a part of the thing, which is to be concluded in the judgement: Or it muſt be taken as only comprehending the outward part of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Reformation which is nothing elſe but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the duties formerly neglected, and abſtaining from the evills formerly committed, and if ſo, then we are juſt where we were, in the miſt yet.</p>

What? muſt this be a generall rule for all profeſſours, that they muſt make a declaration of this experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall work upon their heart, that they may be judged Regenerat and Converts, and ſo capable of admiſſion to the Viſible Church? What warrant for this in the Word? The places pointed at by that laſt Author, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. does not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand any ſuch thing. In the former two <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> indeed char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged theſe people to perform really the work of Reformation and Repentance, that they might not delude themſelves with vain i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations of intereſt in God upon common priviledges: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not of them a declaration of the experimentall work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon their hearts, that thereupon a poſitive judgement might be paſſed concerning the truth of the work in their heart. So in the place, <hi>Acts</hi> 8 37. <hi>Philip</hi> tells the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> what is his duety in relation to the ſuſception of Baptiſm, that he beleeve with all his heart. And together, I confeſſe, inſinuateth the requiring of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſo much, that he might Adminiſtrat baptiſme to him. But neither does <hi>Philip</hi> require, nor the <hi>Eunuch</hi> make a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the experimentall work in his heart, in relation to paſſing a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106774:82"/> poſitive judgement concerning the inexiſtence of the work in his heart. Verily, were this made an univerſall rule or ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judge of profeſſours Converſion, and conſequently of their admiſſion unto Church fellowſhip; many an honeſt, gracious ſoul ſhould never obtain ſuch a judgement upon them while they live; there being many ſuch, who, put them to declarations of this kind, could ſay little or nothing. He that were beſt read in practicall tractats of the nature of Repentance and Faith, and the way of the Spirits working of theſe, and had a gift of utterance, ſhould carry the faireſt ſentence, what ever were the reall work in his heart; if he could but carry fair outwardly in his converſation, as an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may, without ſcandall. Nay, it were in effect to erect a ſtage for hypocrites to out themſelves upon, and to caſt a ſtumbling block in the way of honeſt hearts, not indued with the gift of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing themſelves. I deny not but good uſe may be made of drawing out of Chriſtians, what experience they find of the work of the ſpirit upon their hearts, and conferences between Miniſters and People, and between Chriſtians among themſelves, may and ought prudently to be exerciſed for that end; But I ſpeak againſt the making of declarations of this ſort, a generall rule and ground for judiciall tryall and paſſing judgement concerning the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Converſion of Profeſſours.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>21</label> To conclude this Argument, when theſe particulars held forth by the Word of God are conſidered and laid together. 1. That Regeneration and Converſion being an inward work in the heart, no judgement can be made thereupon by man, but by outward actings. 2. That it is not the outward actings according to their mater, <hi>or the deed done,</hi> but as they are done from ſuch principles, faith, and love, and for ſuch an end, the glorifying and pleaſing of God, that argues the heart to be Regenerat, and the doer to be in Chriſt and in the ſtate of grace, and conſequently, that a man cannot poſitively judge of anothers Regeneration by them, but as they appear, ſomeway, to be done out of ſuch Principles, and for ſuch an end. 3. That actings good upon the mater, may in ſome probabilitie, at leaſt, appear to others, to be done from ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and to ſuch an end, 'tis not enough to have the mans own word and aſſertion for it: but there muſt be, a good time of them,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106774:83"/> and that under ſome varietie of caſes and conditions, and ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. For to act right for a ſtart, or to act right even for a good time, a man coming under no alteration of condition or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſmall or no tentations, does not give much appearance to men without, that theſe actings are right in their principles and ends. 'Tis evenneſſe and conſtancy in alterations of caſes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tentations aſſaulting to turn off the way, that carrieth appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of diſcovery of this. 4. That the greateſt part even of true Converts are not eminent Saints, but weaklings and but as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that unregenerat civilians and hypocrites may in outwards go far beyond many ſound gracious Chriſtians. 5. Yea that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true Converts may be under the prevalency of ſome ſinfull infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and affections, ſo far, as not only to have, but for a long time, may be even to their laſt dayes, as to live (though not with inward liking and allowing (which is not ſeen by others) yet to the outward committing) in known ſinfull actings. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, may not gracious Chriſtians be thus ſubject to an outward courſe of known cankerdneſſe or ſome other the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper? Let theſe things be conſidered and laid together, and tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me if there can be a generall rule whereby there may and ſhould be a judiciall tryall and poſitive judgement paſſed upon all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Profeſſour deſiring the fellowſhip of the Church, concerning their Regeneration or non-regeneration? Wherefore I cannot but commend both the judicious and moderate determination of Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> who when he has laid down the rule or grounds of the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

The learned Author and I are fully agreed upon the mater concerning the outward ground upon which perſons are to be admitted and acknowledged members of the Viſible Church, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſerious profeſſion of the faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding a profeſſion of ſubjection to the commands and ordinances of Chriſt, is ſufficient for this, and that perſons making this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, are without delay or ſearching for triall and diſcoveries of the work of their heart-converſion, to be admitted. The Paſſages he citeth for this purpoſe, <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8 <hi>pag.</hi> 126, 127. are clear for it. I do heartily approve his weighty exhortation ſubjoined thereunto, to theſe of the Independent way, and preſents the ſame to Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> to be laid to heart by him, as in the Lords ſight.

Whereas he ſaith that it is all one to be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible member of the Church and a member of the Viſible Church. And he that denyeth this will but ſhew his vanity.

Again when he ſaith that the

However I confeſſe the ſtrict ſignification is principall and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as to the thing: yet I think all of them are alike proper and none of theſe things has the name by way of reference to another of them. 3. When as he ſaith. <hi>That if we were fully certain by his own externall diſcoveries, that a man were not of the Inviſible Church, that man ſhould not be taken to be of the Viſible; and if any Jew or Pagan were to be taken into the Church upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, we ought not to admit him, except his Profeſſion ſeem to be ſerious and ſincere.</hi> For this I repreſent theſe conſiderations. 1. If we were fully certain by his own externall diſcoveries, that a man were not of the Inviſible Church, neither <hi>actually,</hi> nor <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> or in the purpoſe of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> if we were fully certain by his own externall diſcoveries, that he were a reprobat (as theſe that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe only, diſcovers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſuch) true he were not to be received into the Viſible Church, even becauſe he were known to be, this way not of the Inviſible Church. 2. I confeſſe alſo that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a mans outward carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and way ſuch, as did diſcover him poſitively not to be of the Inviſible Church actually, <hi>i. e.</hi> as did diſcover him poſitively, to be an unregenerat man (though I did not diſcover him to be as a reprobat, <hi>i. e.</hi> not ſo much as potentially of the Inviſible Church) he were not to be received into the fellowſhip of the Viſible. But withall I ſay he were to be debarred or not received, not upon the account of non-regeneration, or upon that cariage conſidered under this formality and reduplication, as a ſigne and diſcovery of non-regeneration; but <hi>materially,</hi> as being contrary to the very outward profeſſion of the faith, for ſuch a cariageonly I conceive it would be this; my reaſon why I deny that non-regeneration or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106774:85"/> any thing conſidered formally under the notion or reduplication, as a ſigne of non-regeneration (which is all one) ſhould be the cauſe for excluding a man from admiſſion into the Viſible Church, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I conceive it is Gods revealed will in his word that men be received into the Viſible Church that they may be Regenerat and converted and that the Miniſteriall diſpenſation of the Ordinances, are by Gods revealed will ſet up in the Church to be means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Converſion, as well as edification of ſuch as are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat. 3. I conceive between ſuch as are in a courſe and cariage, which indeed diſcovers evidently and certainly non-regeneration (<hi>e. g.</hi> as to be without the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, to live in ſome hereſie directly contrary to the foundation, as is Socinianiſm, to live in a conſtant courſe of known prophanity) and ſuch as are ſeemingly Regenerat and ſo to be <hi>poſitively</hi> judged ſuch in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; there may be, yea and are many of a midde ſort who are in ſuch an eſtate and condition outward, and as relating to mans judgement of them that as they do not, unto full certainty of judgement, diſcover themſelves non-regenerat, ſo there is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground poſitively to judge them probably Regenerat, and ſo to uſe them, that is to diſpence Ordinances to them as ſuch and in a way ſuteable to men ſuppoſed to be Regenerat: But the moſt we can in our judgement of their ſtate is to preſcind from paſſing a poſitive judgement either way; as for example, a man when he comes firſt to make a ſerious, ſober profeſſion of the faith, before we have further experience of his way, or of whom we know no more as yet, but that he ſeriouſly profeſſeth the truth, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſubjection to Ordinances, I confeſſe this is a ground ſufficient, probably to judge the man is elect, God has a purpoſe to ſave him, and could we not judge this much probable of him, I will not ſay we ſhould receive him in that caſe. But it is not ſufficient this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and by it ſelf, to ground a poſitive judgement that he is Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat or actually in the ſtate of grace, though you call it a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of probability; my reaſon is this, becauſe to ground a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive act of judgement, that a man is Regenerat <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> there is requiſite ſome ſeemingneſſe (to ſpeak ſo) of ſpirituall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in a mans profeſſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he doth it from a ſpirituall principle, upon ſpirituall motives, and for a ſpirituall end: But a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106774:85"/> meer ſober, not mocking, ſerious profeſſion without more is not a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſpirituall ſupernaturall ſincerity; at leaſt, therefore I humbly conceive it is a miſtake to confound ſeriouſneſſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, if he underſtand ſpiritual or ſupernatural ſincerity (as he muſt underſtand it here) for that is larger then this: many are ſerious in their profeſſion, who are not ſincere in this ſenſe: yea may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeriouſneſſe when they do not as yet give any poſitive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this. And therefore I conceive, he doth not upon good enough ground quarrell with <hi>Tombs, pag.</hi> 129. for that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tombs</hi> requiring a profeſſion ſober, ſerious and underſtanding; he doth diſclaime an enquirie after the ſincerity of their profeſſion, if Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> meant ſupernaturall ſincerity, as I conceive he did; the diſtinction of morall ſincerity, and ſpirituall or ſupernaturall ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is common amongſt practick Divines, and rationall; and there may be poſitive probable evidences of the former, when there is not yet ſo much of the latter. I humbly conceive, there cannot be had poſitive, probable evidences of this, ordinarly, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a mans way after profeſſion for a time, wherein notice may be taken of his walking equally in the latitude of duties, and conſtantly in variety of caſes and conditions. But the other may ſooner and more eaſily appear and poſitively be judged of, as we judge of a mans ſeriouſneſſe in any other action. And 'tis Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own judgement, that as ſoon as a man maketh profeſſion of the faith, without delay or tryall for diſcovery of his heart-Converſion, he is to be admitted into the Viſible Church. To conclude, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and I are at agreement upon the mater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the qualification that is ſufficient for admitting perſons into the Viſible Church, <hi>viz.</hi> ſober ſerious profeſſion, without delay to enquire for more, and ſo we are agreed in the maine about the mater of the Viſible Church: We differ in this that he thinks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not to be admitted, but under the conſideration of perſons judged, at leaſt probably, Converted and Regenerated. My mind is that they are to be admitted under the name of ſerious, ſober, outward profeſſours, abſtracting from Converſion or non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.

For <hi>ex ſuppoſitione conſequentis ſequitur oppoſitum antecedentis, i. e.</hi> if all that are in the Viſible Church be ſuppoſed to be already and antecedently to their reception into the Viſible Church, truly Converted and Regenerated; What is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as a Miniſter, or the Miniſteriall diſpenſation of the Goſpel adoe with Converting of ſouls? All with whom he has to doe as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter are ſuppoſed to be Converted to his hand; and ſo in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry he has only to do with their advancing in grace. This is the more conſtringent towards our Brethren of the Independent way, that they make the Miniſtry relative to a conſtitute Viſible Church only, and that a Miniſter cannot act, as a Miniſter, but in relation to a particular Viſible Church and theſe that are within it: And therefore if a Miniſter by Preaching the Goſpel ſhould be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Converſion and Regeneration of an infidell, yet that is but by accident, and that is not done by him as a Miniſter. If any ſhall ſay that many of theſe who are received into the Viſible Church, albeit they be ſuppoſed and judged to be true Converts and Regenerat ones, yet they may really be unconverted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerated,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106774:86"/> and ſo may, being in the Church and under the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, be converted by the Miniſteriall Preaching of the Goſpel. That is nothing to the purpoſe: 'Tis but by accident that this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, and were it known that a man were unregenerat and unconverted, he were not to be received under the Miniſtry; Yea were he before a member, he ſhould be by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, un-Churched again, untill he were a true Convert. And that which cometh to paſſe by the Miniſtry of the Word, but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, cannot be ſaid to be an end for which it is inſtitute and ſet up in the Church. Yea further I ſay, if the Viſible Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of all and only ſuch as are ſuppoſed and judged, ſo far as men can diſcern, to be antecedently to their admiſſion into the Church, truely Converted and Regenerat; It followeth neceſſarly, that the ordinary Miniſter of the Goſpell has nothing adoe to Preach points of Doctrine tending to preparatory humiliation, awaking of naturall conſciences, and Converting ſouls to Chriſt, but all his Preaching ought to be upon points that concerne comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, directing, ſtrengthning, confirming, ſouls already Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he ſhall have nothing adoe to intreat ſouls to be reconciled to God, but he is only to help them to injoy the ſweetneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Reconciliation, they are already ſtated in; Farewell all Preaching of mens miſerable eſtate by nature, of the terrours of the Law, except only it be to let ſouls know the better what they are delivered from.</p>

Therefore they are appointed to be the ordinary means of Converſion. 3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25. <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient.

'Tis ſo clear from this place that the Miniſters of the Goſpel, by their Miniſteriall Preaching thereof, are the ordinary means appointed by God for Converſion and begetting faith, that it cannot be avoyded, but by denying abſurdly with <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Socinians</hi> and others, everters of the Miniſtry, that by a ſent Preacher is not underſtood any other, but any gifted man, though not called and ſet apart to the Office of the Miniſtry. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, that ſeeing the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is ordained of God to be an ordinary mean of converting the elect and bringing them to Chriſt, it cannot be a condition neceſſarily requiſite in the members of the Viſible Church, antecedently to their admiſſion into the ſociety thereof, that they be already converted, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and judged to be ſuch, ſo far as men can diſcern.

If the mater of the Viſible Church were only reall Saints and the complexion of the Viſible Church true holines and ſaving grace (as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> roundly expreſſeth in his Tenet, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. and that by expreſſe oppoſition to <hi>ſeemingly good, pag.</hi> 25.) or ſuch as are poſitively to be judged ſuch by evidence ſo far as men very ſpirituall can diſcern (as other where he expreſſeth

The connexion of the propoſition M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> cannot deny, for in effect it is his own, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. where he ſayeth Excommunication is an Ordinance to cleanſe the Houſe of God and keep it pure, and according to what it ought to be ſo far as men can diſcern, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Tenet, conſiſting of only reall Saints, and not one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſayeth expreſly that if men creep in, where they ſhould not be (<hi>i. e.</hi> if men not Regenerat creep into the Viſible Church) they are to be caſt out. 'Tis true, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. in the end of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, he mincheth the mater, and ſayeth only, <hi>not one known to be otherwiſe can abide within.</hi> But he ſhould have ſaid, by the conſequence of his Tenet, not one, <hi>not known poſitively, to be ſuch, &amp;c.</hi> As to the Aſſumption, that it is falſe, that for non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation ſimply, or defect of poſitive evidences of Regeneration, perſons are to be caſt out of the Viſible Church. 1. Becauſe there is neither precept nor practice in the Word of God for caſting out any upon this account. Let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> produce us any thing from Scripture of this kind.

I do profeſſe this conſequent following upon this opinion is one of the conſiderations amongſt others, that of a long time has ſwayed me to think, that 'tis a way which is not of God: But on the contrary (tho I eſteem reverently of many of the followers of it and has no harſh thoughts of their intentions therein) that 'tis a ſubtile device of Satan transforming himſelf into an Angel of light, ſet on foot by him as to advance Atheiſm in the World, ſo in ſpeciall to overturn the Proteſtant Religion and Churches. For if none ſhall be permitted to be members of the

Theſe being in all parts the far feweſt number even very few in compariſon: all the reſt (of whom yet, many may have ſome ſeeds of true ſaving grace in them, albeit it be not ſo perceptible to others) tho they were not outwardly contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt the Ordinances, muſt be un-Churched, caſten out, to be no more under any Paſtorall care, for watching over their ſouls; to live as they like, without any ſpirituall means, to reſtrain or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them: to be a ready prey to Satan and his inſtruments, to be turned ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now it being ſo; can any man think that, that way can be of Chriſt, whereby the entrance into the Viſible Church, and ſo to the benefit of the publick Ordinances, which are the ordinary means of obtaining ſalvation, is made ſo ſtrait, that many elect and ſuch as, we cannot but probably judge to be ſuch may he held forth from the benefit of all theſe, ſhut out of the ordinary way of ſalvation: Yea and even many, who may have beginnings of the true grace of Regeneration. If this were not a way to quench ſmoaking flaxes I know not what will be.</p>

As to the former part many of theſe who profeſſe outwardly the faith, willingneſſe to joyn in fellowſhip with the Viſible Church, and to ſubject themſelves to Ordinances, may be of the elect of God. This cannot be denyed, yea nor can we but account them who comes this far on (tho we cannot yet poſitively ſay we account them actually Regenerat men) probably to be elect. Yet by Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Doctrine, tho perſons profeſſe the faith, be deſirous of the fellowſhip of the Church, declare willingneſſe to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Ordinances; Yet unleſſe they be truely Converted, and Regenerat, ſealed of God by his Spirit for his, ſo far as men very ſpirituall can diſcern, they are not to be admitted into the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, and are held forth from the benefit of all the publick Ordinances, the ordinary means of ſalvation. 2. As to the other part, 'tis alſo clear thus; becauſe there may be many ſmoaking
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106774:90"/> flaxes, who have ſome meaſure of true grace in them, who yet not only are weak in knowledge, unable to give an account of all the fundamentalls of Religion, and ſuch points as are neceſſary to lead a life without ſcandall (which yet are required as the ground of that judgement our adverſaries will have to paſſe upon perſons, to be admitted members of the Viſible Church) but alſo under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſenſible, ſinfull infirmities, which may render them ſuſpected to others, to be no reall Saints, may puzle others to paſſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them, at leaſt, may put them to a ſuſpence from paſſing a poſitive judgement upon them, as true ſaints, ſealed of God for his, by his Spirit. And all ſuch by Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Doctrine muſt be held forth from the Viſible Church, and ſo from the benefit of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances, the ordinary means of Salvation. Theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I profeſſe have been to me further motives to make me think the way held forth by this Doctrine concerning the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> of Church members, not to be of Chriſt, it being ſo obſtructive to the proper end and deſign of the ſetting up of the Ordinances and means of grace in the Church, and contrary to Chriſts own way of dealing with ſouls, and yet no caſt-away or unregenerat man ſhall be excluded, if he but be ſtudied in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of theologie, and can carie it fair before men, as indeed hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie may ſtand with great externall formalities of Religion, in word and converſation.</p>

That ſuch perſons may be hearers of the Word, tho they be not admitted members of the Viſible Church, <hi>we admit</hi> ſay they <hi>even infidels to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word.</hi> To this I think Reverend Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> has ſaid truely, that to be admitted as ordinary hearers of the Word, and Church prayers, is a degree of admiſſion to Church-memberſhip; and they who are baptized, and ordinarly hear and profeſſe a willing mind to communicat with the Church in the Holy things of God, they, being not ſcandalouſly wicked, ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yea are members of the Viſible Church. But 2. To ſay that men are not members of the Viſible Church and yet that they may be ordinary hearers of the Word, according to your principles is but a fair word to make Children fain of nothing. For ſay ye, a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106774:91"/> Miniſter is a Miniſter only in relation to his particular flock and the members thereof, therefore ſay I, as a Miniſter he is to Preach the Word only to them, and therefore he muſt ſute his Preaching of the Word unto them, that is unto men ſealed of God by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo far as men very ſpirituall can diſcern, and ſo as a Miniſter or a Miniſteriall Preacher of the Word, he is not obliged to bring any word for hearing, for the caſe of that man that is not a member, and ſo if that man hear ordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But 1. An ordinary Preacher of the Word as a privat Chriſtian, is a Preacher unknown to Scripture. 2. And one and that ſame man Preaching at that ſame time, as a Miniſter to ſome, and as a privat man to other hearers, is far more uncouth to cripture. I beleeve a Miniſter by Scripture rule, ought in his ordinary and publick Preaching of the Word, to act and Preach as a Miniſter, and to be wholly taken up with the work of his Miniſtry: For to that he is appointed of God, and commanded to look to and fulfill, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 4. 17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.</p>

It is ſaid by ſome of them that they will receive any in whom they ſee the leaſt thing of Chriſt, and therefore there is no ſuch hazard of holding out perſons that have not true grace in them. To this, that leaſt thing of Chriſt is ſome outward evidence to ground a poſitive judgement, that the man is Regenerat. Now I inquire what is that leaſt thing of Chriſt, upon ſight whereof. you ſay you will receive men? Is ſober ſerious profeſſion of the true Religion and faith of Chriſt and of ſubjecting a mans ſelf to the Ordinances and Government of Chriſt, ſufficient to you, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you will receive him? Or muſt there be ſomewhat more to make it up? If you ſaid the former, we were at agreement, upon the mater, about the qualification neceſſary <hi>in ſoro Eccleſiae,</hi> for admitting of perſons to be Church members: but this you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not to be ſufficient: Let men thus ſeriouſly and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106774:91"/> profeſſe, there muſt be a time for obſerving their converſation, and their muſt be a tryall and ſearching into the experimentall work in their hearts: Now if it muſt be ſomewhat more then that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what is the leaſt thing more? We have ſeen before what they held forth in their rules of tryall, and dare ſay (yea thinks it were unchriſtian, unwarrantable rigidneſſe to ſay the contrary) that there may be and are many honeſt, ſincere Converts, in whom there is not to be ſeen by others, and who cannot ſhew to others, that which they hold forth as the leaſt, more then that which we have ſaid; and therefore ſtill by their way many truly Regenerat may be held forth, tho deſirous of Church communion, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſubjection to the Word and Ordinances of Chriſt; for my part. I had rather, twenty hypocrites were let in, then that one graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul, yea or Elect, tho yet not Regenerat, come this far on, as to deſire to be in, and to profeſſe ſubjection, ſhould be held forth, and yet this accurate and pretended cleanly way of theſe Brethren, tho it tend to exclude many, who may be are truely Regenerat, yet it may let in any unregenerat, if they can but play the Hypocrite handſomely, and have ſome Book-learned-knowledge.</p>

                     <hi>Argument</hi> 7. Shall be taken from theſe deſcriptions of the Viſible Church in the Word of God holding it forth to us frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a mixed ſociety of good and bad, under the ſimilitudes of a barn floore, wherein is an heap of wheat and chaffe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. of a corn field wherein are growing together tares and wheat, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 24. of a draw-net gathering in good fiſh and bad, <hi>ibid. verſ.</hi> 47. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of a great houſe wherein are veſſels of Gold and Silver, and veſſels of Wood and Earth, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2. 21. I confeſſe this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hath not been well managed againſt the oppoſites, which has given them occaſion to ſlight it, as proving nothing but what themſelves grant. For when no more is alledged from theſe places, but that the Viſible Church is ſuch a ſociety, as even when rightly conſtitute, there are in it a mixture of true beleevers and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, they ſay they yeeld the Argument wholly, that in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Viſible Churches, there may and will alwayes be a mixture of hypocrites with true beleevers and Saints, <hi>de facto:</hi> but that the Queſtion is what ſort of perſons ought, <hi>de jure</hi> to be admitted or
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106774:92"/> permitted to be members of the Viſible Church. But the places duely pondered and conſidered together will afford us a more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Argument, which will not leave open a way for ſuch an eſcape. We preſent it thus in form: if the Lord himſelf deſcribing the outward conſtitution of the Viſible Church, as to the mater where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it conſiſteth; not only holdeth it forth as a mixed ſociety of ſome truely good, and gracious, and ſome bad unconverted and graceleſſe ones: But alſo declareth that his will is that his ſervants ſhould not caſt out of it all ſuch as they conceive to be bad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, but that they permit even ſuch in the outward Viſible Church, leaving to himſelf to make the full ſeparation of the one from the other: Then it cannot be that by his apointment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it ſhould be the neceſſary qualification of Viſible Church-members, <hi>in foro Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> that they be all true converts and gracious ones, at leaſt, ſo far as men can diſcern and judge, this propoſition if the conſequence and connexion thereof hold good; leaves no door open for the former eſcapes, as is evident: and I conceive that the connexion or conſequence of it, is undenyable, becauſe upon the ſuppoſition of the oppoſite of the conſequent fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes clearly the oppoſite of the antecedent, that is to ſay, if it were Chriſts inſtitution and will that true grace, at leaſt, ſo far as men can diſcern and judge, ſhould be the neceſſary qualification, <hi>in foro Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> of all Church-members, it ſhould clearly follow that it were his will, and the duty of his ſervants to caſt out all ſuch in the Viſible Church, as they did ſee not to be qualified, not gracious converts, which is flatly contrary to that which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the antecedent. Now I aſſume that the antecedent is clearly held forth to us in theſe places. 1. 'Tis clear that in theſe places he holdeth forth the Viſible Church in its outward conſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That not only he permits it to be ſo untill the laſt day: But alſo 'tis his will and he commands his ſervants to permit ſuch to abide in the Church as even to their diſcerning are bad, leaving the ſeparation of them to himſelf at the laſt. <hi>The ſervant ſaid unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</hi> Yes, would Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſay, leave not one of them; No not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106774:92"/> one of them in a Viſible Church; they are where they ought not to be, they want the complexion of the Viſible Church, &amp;c. But ſayeth the Lord himſelf: Nay, but let both grow together untill the Harveſt.</p>

It is mater of grief and offence to ſee in the Church of Chriſt ſo many unprofitable weeds—5. The raſh zeal of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants before they conſult their Lord and Maſter is ready with the hazard of the Church and true members thereof, to have ſuch a conſtitution of the Viſible Church as they ſhould ſuffer none to be a member, who are not inwardly Regenerat: But have all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of whoſe inward Regeneration they are not aſſured plucked from among Profeſſours. 6. The Lord although he hath given order to cenſure ſcandalous offenders, yet he diſcharges his ſervants to preſſe towards ſuch a ſeparation, as to have all weeds and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in heart to be caſt out; Leaſt while they gather out the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe tares, they ſhould root out alſo the gracious wheat with them: For it is not poſſible for any man to diſcern the renewed from the unrenewed ſo clearly but he may be miſtaken. 8.

The cauſe why I do this, thus apart in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices, is partly becauſe I was loath to interrupt ſo much, the threed of Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Examination: Partly becauſe it was long time, and I had gone on a great way in that Examination, ere a Copy of this Letter came to my hands.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106774:96"/> qualification of a member of the Viſible Church Univerſall, one thing, and the neceſſary qualification of a member of this or that particular Congregation, another; and may one be fit to be a member of the Univerſall Viſible Church, and yet not qualified to be a member of a particular Congregation?

Which I am perſwaded nor they nor any living man ſhall ever be able to do. 3. When as they ſpeak not <hi>ſimply,</hi> of members, but <hi>diſtinctly,</hi> of <hi>conſtitute</hi> members <hi>(none ſay they are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as conſtitute members of a Viſible Church)</hi> I would aske them what is the other part of the diſtinction? What other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are there of the Viſible Church, unto which theſe conſtitute members are contradiſtinguiſhed? How are they called in their ſpecification? And what is their neceſſary qualification? 4. When as they ſay that none are to be admitted conſtitute members, <hi>but ſuch as with a profeſſion of the truth, joyn ſuch blameleſſe and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-like behaviour as they may be eſteemed in a rationall charity beleevers. i. e.</hi> true gracious beleevers with a ſaving faith. 1. I would ask here why do they omit that part of the qualification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and made a part of the ground of eſteeming perſons belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by others of that way they have taken themſelves to? <hi>viz.</hi> a declaration of the experimentall work of effectuall vocation upon their heart, and only mentioned the behaviour or converſation. 2. Why have they not defined that blameleſſe and Goſpel like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour which is requiſite to be a ground of eſteeming perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, what at leaſt is requiſite and muſt concurre to make it up, and leſſe then which will not ſerve? That ſo we might have the generall determinat rule, whereby cognition is to be made and eſtimation to be paſſed upon all profeſſours of the truth, that they are beleevers, or otherwayes. For certainly while as they ſay, but indefinitly, <hi>ſuch a blameleſſe and Goſpel behaviour,</hi> and tells not what is requiſite to make up ſuch a behaviour, they leave the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106774:96"/> in a miſt of uncertainty, and for ought we can ſee, devolves the weight of that eſtimation upon mens apprehenſions without a rule. If they ſay they were writing an Epiſtle to friends, and could not therein ſay all that is to be ſaid in the mater. I Anſwer, that, if they could have told it, it might been ſaid in ſhort bounds, and it was as neceſſary for clearing their mind, to have been told as the Theſis, they have ſet down, it ſelf. But yet let them point us to ſuch a rule in the Word, if they know where it lyeth. For my part, I profeſſe humbly, I could never yet ſee in the Word of God, an univerſall definite rule whereby judgement may and ought to be paſſed upon all and every profeſſour of the truth, by others, that they are to be held for true beleevers or otherwiſe. 5. When as in the deſignation of the perſons that are fit to be admitted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Viſible Church, they with Parents, joyn their children. I do heartily acknowledge their Orthodoxy in this, beyond others of that way, who have omitted wholly that addition, and wiſhes they may continue in that point of truth, conſidering how eaſie it is, as the Authors of that Epiſtle themſelves may perceive by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in others that went off with them firſt, by that ſtep they have gone on to ſlide into that other of excluding the Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers from the Viſible Church. But now I would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they acknowledge ſuch Infants members compleatly, I mean <hi>in actu primo,</hi> or not? If they ſay the former, they are at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement with others of the Independent way. If they ſay the latter, then we muſt have another diſtinction of conſtitute mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and ſo many ſorts of members of the Viſible Church, and ſo alſo, we muſt have many ſorts of qualifications of members.</p>

I ſhall not here adde any new reaſons to what I have brought before: But ſhall come briefly to conſider if theſe preſent Authors have brought any new ſtrength of reaſon for that Tenet: Only I would deſire them in the fear and love of the truth, to conſider if they can find in the Word of God, amongſt all theſe many, whoſe admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106774:97"/> the fellowſhip of the Viſible Church of Chriſt, is mentioned therein; any inſtance of perſons or one perſon, who after their firſt profeſſing Chriſtian faith and Religion, was, what ever their behaviour and courſe had been before to that very time, delayed of their admiſſion to be Church-members untill they ſhould be ſeen and found, with that their profeſſion, to joyn ſuch a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and Goſpel-like behaviour, as the Authors requires; many of them, no doubt, untill that time had been of a very blameable and un Goſpel behaviour and courſe of life: And certain it is, that to be ſeen joyning with profeſſion of the truth, an unblameable and Goſpel-like behaviour requires ſome delay and length of time. For my part I could never yet ſee any inſtance of this kind, but on the contrary; finds, that perſons, as ſoon as they once embraced the profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, albeit to that very time their behaviour had been moſt blameable, were forthwith baptized and ſo admitted members into the Chriſtian Church. Conſider this, I beſeech you dear brethren, if ſo ye will yet ſuffer your ſelves to be called and exhorted by me.</p>

But if you can bring ſolid reaſon to prove they muſt be underſtood otherwiſe, we ſhall yeeld as to this; We give more aſſent to one ſolid reaſon, then to an hundred Authorityes of meer men. Come we then to ſee what reaſon is brought to prove they ought to be underſtood otherwiſe. 1. <hi>For that</hi> (ſay they) <hi>they are to be underſtood of them all according to the judgement of charity: The Holy Ghoſt has clearly ſaid, Rom.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>To all that be at Rome, beloved of God, called Saints.</hi> And again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>I thank my God for you all.</hi> This the firſt, then they ſubjoyn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>We hope when the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>flee forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, none will deny but he ſpeaks to the whole Church: Yet to the ſame perſons he immediatly addes, verſ.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>Your body is</hi>

                     <hi>the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt which is in you, you are not your own, you are bought with a price, this is an Argument taken from the condition of the perſons whom he exhorteth thus. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is to all the Church of Corinth. Therefore they were all ſuch as the Apoſtle judged in charity the redeemed of the Lord. Anſw.</hi> Remember what we have ſaid before, that tho all were granted that is here alledged, yet the main point in Queſtion touching the conſtitution of theſe Churches is not proven. The main point in Queſtion is upon what formall conſideration only, the members of which theſe Churches did conſiſt, were received and admitted into the conſtitution thereof. But the moſt that can be made out of what is alledged here, let it all be granted, is, that all the members were ſuch <hi>de facto</hi> and <hi>eventually;</hi> this being remembered, to the preſent purpoſe. 1. Suppoſe it were granted, and that the reaſons alledged did prove, that theſe titles, as given to the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> were to be underſtood as the Authors will, of all and every one in theſe Churches, that they were judged by the Apoſtle in charity, the Redeemed of the Lord, truly ſanctified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is hereby clear and evinced that ſo theſe titles, muſt be underſtood alſo, when they are given to the other Churches founded by the Apoſtles? I know the chief Author of the Epiſtle has more skill (however it be with others of them) in Logick, then to think ſo, and hopes he doth not ſo deſpiſe others that have any tolerable knowledge that way, as to think they would take ſuch a thing off his hand, and therefore wonders, that having undertaken to prove that all the Churches founded by the Apoſtles, were conſtitute of ſuch members as were all poſitively judged in charity, Redeemed and Sanctified, becauſe of the titles of Redeemed and Sanctified given to them: And then that theſe titles given to them, muſt not be underſtood <hi>ſynecdochically</hi> by a denomination taken from the better part; but of all and every one of them: In the proof of this he brings in two of them, without ſo much as one word of aſſay to prove the like of the reſt. If it ſhal be ſaid that if that be proven of one or two, it is proven alſo by conſequence of the reſt. I deny it, for the Queſtion being about the ſenſe wherein a title aſcribed to ſeverall particular Societies, whether, <hi>viz.</hi> it be aſcribed to them <hi>univerſally</hi> as competent to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106774:98"/> all and every individuall contained therein; Or only by a deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination taken from a better part of theſe individualls? To prove that is to be ſo or ſo underſtood of one or two of them, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to conclude, that ſo it is to be underſtood of the reſt: If yet it ſhall be replied, that there is no reaſon why it ſhould not be ſo underſtood of the reſt of theſe Churches, as of theſe expreſſed. I anſwer this much at leaſt ſhould have been alledged (which is not) to have made the Argument in appearance, at leaſt, to have ſome force for the main point intended. But what if, tho it ſhould be granted that theſe titles are attributed to the two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches expreſſed here, are to be underſtood as ſpoken of them <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally:</hi> yet it ſhall be ſhown that in ſome other of theſe Churches founded by the Apoſtles, there were perſons to whom theſe titles could not be applyed? We conceive this hath been done before in our anſwer to Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> particularly of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and that the 2 and 3. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> hold the ſame clearly forth of ſome others. But 2. as for that brought for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we refer to what we have anſwered before to M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Lockier,</hi> in that ſame purpoſe. 3. As to the Argument brought to prove that the title of Redeemed (and conſequently the reſt) is given to all and every one of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> it lyeth thus in form as propounded by the Authors themſelves. The Apoſtle exhorting the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to flee fornication, taketh an Argument from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the perſons whom he exhorteth (to wit that they were Redeemed) but the exhortation is to all the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Therefore they were all ſuch as the Apoſtle judged in charity to be Redeemed of the Lord. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I wonder exceeding much, that ſuch a looſly formed Argument ſhould have come from the hand of ſuch a Philoſophe, as I take to have been the principall Author of this Epiſtle; for take it as it lyeth here, it looketh not like a peece of arte, a ſyllogiſm conſiſting of three terms: but ſeemeth to have ſome more. But to take it in the moſt candid way, I conceive it may be reſolved into thoſe two proceſſes to make it formall, the firſt may be thus, all theſe to whom the Apoſtles exhortation to flee fornication there is directed, are by him called Redeemed: And ſo were at leaſt to his judgement of charity. But to all the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is that exhortation of the Apoſtles directed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106774:99"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other is for proof of the major or firſt propoſition of that, thus: Theſe perſons who are exhorted to flee fornication by an Argument taken from Redemption as their condition are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Redeemed by the Apoſtle: But all theſe to whom that exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is directed are exhorted by an Argument taken from that condition. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now then to <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. I think the aſſumption of the firſt ſyllogiſm may well be denyed; <hi>viz.</hi> that exhortation is directed to all and every one in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> the Authors prove it not; Only they think it ſo evident, that none will deny it. But for what reaſon they are ſo confident of this I know not, unleſſe it be this, that flying fornication was a duety incumbent to them all and every one of them. But this reaſon is not conſtringent; for why may not a duty, which is in a common obligation incumbent to all, be preſſed upon ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar perſons by an exhortation particularly intended and directed for them? I can ſee no circumſtance in the Text here, why we may not conceive this exhortation, tho to a duty of common obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, yet particularly intended and directed by the Apoſtle to the elect and truely redeemed amongſt them, not diſtinctly by the head and name pointing them out, but <hi>confuſè,</hi> in the Viſible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety they were amongſt. 2. Paſſing that aſſumption of the firſt ſyllogiſm: the aſſumption of the ſecond which is brought to prove the major of the firſt, is as looſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that all theſe perſons to whom the exhortation is directed, or are exhorted to flee fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are exhorted by that Argument taken from redemption as their condition. This may well be denyed, for why may not an exhortation to a common duty, directed to a whole ſociety mixed of perſons of different ſpirituall conditions, be preſſed upon all by ſome Arguments common to all (ſuch as that whereby this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is preſſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.) and upon ſome, by ſome ſpeciall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument relating properly to them. There can be no circumſtance of the context alledged to prove, why it may not be conceived to be ſo here, ſuppoſing that the exhortation is directed to all? But, 3. To beat out the bottom of this Argument, I prove from the very Text it ſelf that the Apoſtle here ſpeaking to the perſons, whom he calleth redeemed, ſpeaketh of them as ſuch in the verity of the thing or object, <hi>i. e.</hi> as truly and really redeemed and conſequently
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106774:99"/> cannot be conceived to ſpeak it of all and every one in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as the Authors themſelves will confeſſe, I doubt not. I prove it thus, theſe whom the Apoſtles calls Redeemed here, they are ſuch as might and ought themſelves to know, and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that they were Redeemed, and had the Spirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them. But only ſuch as are in real<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty and <hi>the verity of the thing,</hi> Redeemed, &amp;c. may and ought to know and be aſſured of this of themſelves. Therefore the ſecond Part of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is clear, becauſe otherwiſe a man might and ought to know and be aſſured of a lie, concerning his eſtate, which is deluded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The firſt part is alſo clear from the Apoſtles words, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>What? know ye not that your bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. That <hi>know ye not</hi> ſo frequently uſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, eſpecially in theſe Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and in this very <hi>Chapter</hi> five times, imports a certain aſſurance of the thing he is ſpeaking of, and therefore here the Apoſtle imports that theſe whom he is ſpeaking to as redeemed, and having the Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, they are ſuch as may and ought to be aſſuredly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they were redeemed. And is not this place parallel to that of the very like expreſſion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you?</hi> Which all Proteſtant Divines preſſe againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts for proving Believers certain aſſurance and perſwaſion of grace and ſalvation. Therefore I conclude: That the Apoſtle by theſe whom he calls the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, underſtands them that are ſuch indeed and in truth of the object, and not in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity; And what an incongruous interpretation were it to put upon theſe words, <hi>Know ye not that ye are the temples of the Holy Ghoſt redeemed with a price?</hi> this ſenſe; Know ye not that ye are accounted in the judgment of charity, temples of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Yet I think it cannot in truth be ſaid that all and every one in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were judged poſitively by the Apoſtle in the judgment of charity, gracious, renewed and ſanctified ones, even becauſe of the groſſe wickedneſſe he in theſe Epiſtles expreſſeth himſelf to have known to be amongſt them.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106774:101"/> well as theſe latter, were to be accounted but infirmities of Saints? Nay, albeit I deny not, but atheiſticall doubtings may ariſe and infeſt the hearts of gracious ones (which yet are a torment to them) yet I ſee not how a formed deniall of that fundamentall point of the Reſurrection, now ſince Chriſts Reſurrection, and ſo clear and full revelation of the Goſpel, can be conſiſting in the heart with true ſaving faith; And is it not upon this very account that the Apoſtle ſpeaking to theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> in that 15. <hi>cap. verſ.</hi> 34. ſayeth, <hi>ſome</hi> (he means of their Church, as the <hi>Nether Dutch</hi> Notes well obſerve) <hi>have not the knowledge of God, i. e.</hi> they have not ſaving knowledge of God. 2.

To ſuppoſe this, (as the Authors do but ſuppoſe it here) is nothing elſe but to ſuppoſe and beg the thing in Queſtion without any proof of it. 2. I conceive the Authors are in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, when as they take that, 2 <hi>Theſ,</hi> 3. 5. <hi>eſteem</hi> him (it is, <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh</hi> him, in the text) <hi>as a brother,</hi> to import neceſſarily the accounting a man one truely Regenerat; For in Chriſtianity as there is a ſpeciall brotherhood in regard of communion in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating grace; ſo there is a common brotherhood, in regard of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profeſſion of Chriſtian Faith and Religion, and it is ſufficient to underſtand a <hi>brother</hi> in that place, in that more common notion and relation, as is evident by the oppoſition there made to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Tho I think the Apoſtle there is not ſo much ſpeaking of the ſtate of the man cenſured, what it is, or ought to be judged; As what the affection and cariage of theſe yet in the Church ought to be towards him for his good.

                  <p>Their is ere they come to the next, this word caſten in, <hi>but this is not our caſe; our Churches are overflowed with a deluge of prophane Atheiſts, who have been ſuch from their birth to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hour,</hi> which I can no otherwiſe look upon in this place of their Epiſtle, but as an untimous eruption of deſpite againſt their mother Church.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106774:102"/> upon it as a ground in admitting perſons to his baptiſm, a bare verball profeſſion may be apparently in jeſt, mocking, and in groſſe palpable hypocriſie. <hi>Iohn</hi> no doubt would not thought ſuch a profeſſion a ſufficient ground: nor do we think it either. But between ſuch a profeſſion, and a profeſſion wherewith are ſeen preſently and actually fruits meet for Repentance, <hi>i. e.</hi> poſitively evidencing and proving true Repentance in the heart; there is a profeſſion ſober and ſerious, tho for the preſent there be not, nor can be for the preſent, ſeen ſuch fruits, meet for Repentance joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it, ſuch a Profeſſion we ſay as this, is a ſufficient ground to admit to Baptiſme upon; And upon ſuch a Profeſſion, we ſay <hi>Iohn</hi> admitted thoſe to baptiſme, that came to him to be baptized, without enquiring or waiting to ſee fruits meet for Repentance. For it is moſt evident by comparing the Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> yea and <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 23. that great multitudes of people coming to him were baptized by him together, at the ſame time. Now I pray how did <hi>Iohn</hi> ſee fruits meet for Repentance in all and every one of theſe by themſelves? was he acquaint with every one of their converſations perſonall, before they came there, who will be ſo impudent as to hazard upon ſuch an aſſertion eſpecially, of him who lived in the wilderneſſe remote from their Cities and Societies? Or after they came forth to him and offered themſelves to be baptized, did <hi>Iohn</hi> delay their baptiſm and they abide in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him, ſo long a time (which could not be for ſome few dayes, yea or weeks) as he might ſee ſuch fruits in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>viz.</hi> (as the Authors of this way tell us) omitting no known duty, and committing no known evill, or leading a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation without ſcandall? Who will ſay or beleeve this either? Or did <hi>Iohn</hi> ſee theſe, by examining every one of them ſeverally, and cauſing them make a declaration of the experimentall work of Repentance upon their heart? 1. But how could he do this, with ſo great multitudes, yea when all is done, this would be nothing but verball profeſſion of the work, and not fruits, ſpoken of in the Text, which are reall good works and practices in life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. And as to their hinting at the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> words, <hi>bring forth fruits meet for Repentance:</hi> As if it were imported thereby, that <hi>Iohn</hi> is requiring the works to be brought forth, and that he might
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106774:102"/> ſee them in relation unto, and before his adminiſtration of baptiſm to them, is a groſſe miſtake or deceit; for it is evident that <hi>Iohn</hi> is not requiring a qualification in relation to his adminiſtration of baptiſm to them; But Preaching their duty, without which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their profeſſion nor outward baptiſm, nor any other outward priviledge or prerogative ſhould ſave them from the wrath of God. Yea it is evident that this Sermon exhortatorie was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preached to the purpoſe the Authors intimats, that it was Preached either in the time of the adminiſtration, or rather after the adminiſtration was performed; As would appear by <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 8. <hi>I indeed a have baptized you.</hi>

O! but firſt this is an Old Teſtament Scripture ſpoken in relation to the then Churches of the Old Teſtament (whatever the place importeth) as well as to the Goſpel Churches. Now why then did you before, as ſeems with your Maſter, reſtrict your Doctrine concerning the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Church-members to the Goſpel Churches?

Nor yet taking them in the former; According
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106774:105"/> to which the ſimple meaning of them, is no other but that which is expreſſed in the lateſt edition of the Engliſh Annot. on the place <hi>a holy life and converſation becometh them that profeſſe themſelves to be ſervants to ſo great and glorious a Majeſty,</hi> and who of us will deny this: this importeth what is the duty of all that profeſſe themſelves to be in ſo neer a relation to God as his Houſe, which is to be Holy in the Truth of the thing or object, and not only ſo to cary it before men as to be eſteemed by them ſuch in charity, which men may doe without the reality or Trueth of the thing. And this we grant, that men profeſſing themſelves the people of God ought in duty, as they would anſwer their profeſſion, to be truely Holy.

I know not well whom they mean by theſe, few at leaſt precious men whom they inſinuate to acknowledge their rule; Except they mean themſelves who have ſinfully ſeparated themſelves from the Church of Chriſt. But I may ſay they have no cauſe to weep and ſay alas for the precious men that will not acknowledge their new rule of conſtituting Viſible Churches: becauſe it is a rule that God never conſtituted for that purpoſe; But they have cauſe to weep and ſay alas (which I pray God of his Grace they may do) for themſelves that they have ſeparated themſelves from the Church of Chriſt upon the very ground that Donatiſts ſeparated of old.</p>

But ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by his way the Elderſhip as contradiſtinguiſhed from other profeſſours, and as the Elderſhip has no power, nor can exert any power at all; I mean power of authority in theſe maters: All their part is meerly to preſide and moderate the meeting of the Church, and as a Moderator, or Chair-man, to propone and ſtate a Queſtion; Ask and gather the votes, and declare the ſentence

It cannot conſiſt with what he ſaith afterward in ſundry of his Arguments brought to prove his Aſſertion: In the firſt thereof he alledgeth that the power of the Keyes are given to perſons not as Officers, Apoſtles, or Elders, <hi>but as beleevers, to the Church of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and beleeving with ſuch a faith as fleſh and blood cannot reveal,</hi> but I aſſume that Women are beleevers, and beleevers with ſuch a faith as well as Men, <hi>Ergo,</hi> by his Argument they muſt have an hand in the Government by their conſent and approbation as well as the men. Again in the third, whereas he alledges, <hi>that other wayes</hi> (viz. <hi>than as he aſſerted) the Elders cannot but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the little ones of the Church, yea the tender conſciences of ſtronger Brethren, for as much as perſons may be taken in and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten out concerning which they can have no diſtinct knowledge.</hi> I aſſume, that this will hold as well for women, little ones of the Church and ſiſters of tender conſciences, as well as men; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe offending of theſe muſt be eſchewed as well as of thoſe. Further in his fourth Argument, he alledgeth as a ground of his Aſſert. <hi>that the ſpirit of diſcerning is not confined to Elders: but may be in great meaſure in ſome of the members, and a greater gift when all are joyned together in the Name of Chriſt, and his preſence with them to diſcern and judge.</hi> And addeth, <hi>that the Saints ſhall Judge the World:</hi> All which take in female Saints as well as male Saints.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106774:113"/> the Elders muſt not in theſe weighty maters of Government, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Members, ordination of Miniſters, cenſures, exert power without the authoritative joynt acting and concurring of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the body of profeſſours therein, with them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If this conſequence be good, then it muſt follow as well that Miniſters cannot exert power of authoritative Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel but with the joynt authoritative concurrence of the people in Preaching with them. For certain it is that the power of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel is comprehended in theſe Keyes given to <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as the power of cenſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore if it follow, the power of the keyes was not given to <hi>Peter</hi> as an Apoſtle, nor as an Elder, but as a Believer: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Elders cannot exert power in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, cenſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the joint authorative concurrence of the body of Profeſſours therein, it muſt follow alſo: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they cannot exert power in preaching the Goſpel without their joynt authoritative concurrence therein: and ſo when the Miniſter prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, all the people muſt authoritatively preach with him, elſe his preaching is null. 2. But waving this, and granting it were true that the power of the keyes was firſt given to believers, and ſo to <hi>Peter,</hi> not as a Miniſter, but as repreſenting Believers. I do not ſee how it muſt of neceſſity follow that the body of Profeſſours muſt act authoritatively, jointly with the Rulers in the exerting of that power. For we may ſuppoſe it was given to the body of the Church, not formally, but radically and virtually to be by them derived to Rulers to be formally exerted by theſe only, and then the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will not follow; as, ſuppoſe it were true, which many Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, and with them ſome Divines, maintain (which yet for my ſelf I cannot ſee ſolide proof of) that the power of Civile Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is firſt given of God by a naturall right unto the body of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yet from this it followeth not, that no Magiſtrates elected by people muſt exert power of Government without the joint autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative concurrence of the people with them; Then when ever a King is to exert an act of Government, or a Parliament, they muſt do nothing, unleſſe the people ſit down upon the Throne or in the houſe with them, and thus no doubt ſundry Divines in former times, when they ſay that the power of the Keyes were given firſt to the whole Church of beleevers, are to be underſtood to have
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106774:113"/> meant, that this power was given to them not to be formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and abiding in themſelves, to be exerted and exerciſed by them: But virtually, by them to be ſetled upon ſuch perſons as they ſhould deſigne for Miniſteriall offices in the Church, by whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is to be formally exerted and exerciſed, which yet is a miſtake.</p>

The conſequent as here inferred is much different from that which is propounded in the beginning of the paragraph, there it was propounded thus, the power of the Keyes was not firſt given to <hi>Peter</hi> as, &amp;c. but as a beleever, here it is the Keyes of power, the former expreſſion, (ſuppoſing there were ſuch a diſtinction of Keyes, as Keyes of power, and another ſort of Keyes different from theſe) being indefinite, may import both, but the latter impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a ſpecification of a definite ſort of Key<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s. What means this variation? That the Reader may underſtand this myſtery the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 'tis to be obſerved, that when as hitherto in the Church of God, by the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, being underſtood the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt which he hath appointed to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrate in his Church, or the power of adminiſtring theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances under himſelf, theſe Keyes have been diſtributed unto the <hi>Key of Knowledge,</hi> or Doctrine, which is the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, taking in therewith the Sacraments as the Appendicles and ſeals of the Goſpel, and the <hi>Key of Juriſdiction,</hi> or Diſcipline, which conſiſts in Cenſures and abſolution from Cenſures: Independents of late have forged new ſorts of the Keyes, whereby they have confounded themſelves, and wound confound the whole Church of Chriſt in the mater of its Government. They tell us there is 1. a Key of Knowledge or Faith, the firſt ſubject whereof is every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, whether joined to a particular Congregation, or not. 2. A
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106774:114"/> Key of intereſt, power or liberty, which is in all the Brethren of a particular Congregation. And 3. a Key of Rule and Authority, which they ſay is in the Elders of a particular Church or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. The meaning and refutation of theſe new forged Keyes ſee in <hi>Jus Divin.</hi> of Church Govern. <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 108, 109. &amp;c. and Mr. <hi>Caudreys Vindiciae clav. c.</hi> 2. <hi>per tot.</hi> Now when Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> in the conſequent of his Argument ſpeaks of the Keyes of power, it would ſeem he muſt underſtand that ſecond kinde of Keyes. For I know no other going under that name amongſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents. Yet may be, by a new conception of his own, he means that all power of government diſtinguiſhed from the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word and Adminiſtration of Sacraments, exerciſed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Miniſters, and diſpenſation of cenſures. Again ſee another great variation. At firſt he propounds that the Keyes were given to <hi>Peter</hi> firſt as a beleever. This may import (and as ſpoken there by the Author without any explication, cannot be otherwiſe underſtood but that it doth import) that they were given to him as a ſingle beleever; but now in the conſequent inferred in the pretended proof, he ſayeth thus, they were given firſt to <hi>the Church of beleevers,</hi> this is a ſociety of perſons collectively and unitedly taken, and not perſons ſingly. 2. Where ſhall we ever read, the Elders or Miniſters called the Officers and Servants of the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, (as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> meaneth) by way of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church as a Superiour, or Miſtreſſe, deputing and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to officiat and act in her place? We find indeed they are called the ſervants of the Church of beleevers by way of relation of a means to an end, for their good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. as Angels or Miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to Miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> But they are only Chriſts Officers and Servants, by way of relation of Deputs to officiat, and imployed to ſerve unto a Superior and Maſter deputing to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat, and imploying to ſerve in his place, and are ſet over the Church by him.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>5</label> But now conſider we how this conſequent is proven. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as propounded by the Author is Enthymematick, and muſt ſuppoſe another premiſſe beſide that which is expreſſed, which muſt be true as well as that expreſſed, to make the conſequence
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106774:115"/> good. Now I humbly deſire him to give us that ſuppreſſed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed premiſſe. Verily, keep him to one ſyllogiſme, and it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to do it, obſerving the rules of good Logick and reaſon. But it may be done, may be, by two proceſſes; Well then, they muſt be theſe for ought that I can conceive, (if he can do it otherwiſe and better, let him do it, and we ſhall conſider of it) the firſt is this, that which was given to <hi>Peter</hi> upon the confeſſion of his faith, was given to him as a Beleever: But the Power of the Keyes were given to <hi>Peter</hi> upon the confeſſion of his faith <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this concluſion for a ground of the ſecond it muſt be thus That which was given to <hi>Peter</hi> as a Beleever, was given to the Church believing with ſuch a faith as <hi>Peter</hi> believed. But to <hi>Peter</hi> as a Believer was the Keyes of Power given <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> It might be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the major or firſt propoſition of this latter ſylogiſme, that which was given to <hi>Peter</hi> as a Believer was given to the Church as believing with ſuch a faith, as he believed with; That if in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute thereof, the Church be underſtood <hi>collectively,</hi> for the ſociety of ſuch Believers, as united and aſſociated; and withall when it is ſaid, that what was given to <hi>Peter</hi> as a Believer was given to the Church (thus taken collectively) believing with ſuch faith, the meaning be, that it was given only to the Church conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> collectively: then the connexion is not neceſſary (and ſo it is falſe, becauſe it is materially and indeed an hypothetick propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and in an hypothetick propoſition, if the connexion be not neceſſary, the propoſition is falſe, as Logicians knows) for that which was given to <hi>Peter</hi> as a believer, might be given to the Church as believing diſtributively, <hi>i. e.</hi> to every one of the Church belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſingly. If it ſhall be ſaid, that that propoſition may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus that which was given to <hi>Peter</hi> as a Believer not ſingly conſidered; But as aſſociated with others, that was given to the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>6</label> But the weight of all this proof brought by our Author here, hangs upon the major or firſt propoſition of the former ſyllogiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> what power was given to <hi>Peter</hi> upon the confeſſion of his faith, was given to him as a beleever, <hi>i. e.</hi> conſidered under this formality, to be a power competent to him, ſimply as he was a beleeving perſon. The weight of all the proof, I ſay, hangs ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that unleſſe it ſtand good and be neceſſary, all falls to the ground, and indeed it is but a groundleſſe ſuppoſition, of no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and may be as eaſily denyed, as it is ſuppoſed. Why? Might it not be, that Chriſt did upon <hi>Peters</hi> making ſo eminent a confeſſion of faith give unto him a power, competent to him not ſimply, as beleeving with ſuch a faith, and ſo not common to all beleeving with ſuch a faith: But officiall competent to him as in ſuch a particular office amongſt beleevers, or conſtituting him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, ſuch an Officer? What evidence or neceſſity of reaſon can be brought to the contrair of this? I think M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> did wiſeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſuppreſſe and ſuppoſe this baſis of his proof, then to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it, becauſe the expreſſion of it would too evidently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the weakneſſe of his proof of his main point, that the Keyes of power, or power of the Keyes, was firſt given to beleevers, and not to the Officers in the Church. And now I muſt profeſſe, I wonder much, that (after ſo many learned men have debated ſo much on that Text and brought ſo many conſiderable Arguments to prove that it cannot be meant in that place, that the power of the Keyes was given to <hi>Peter</hi> ſimply as a beleever, or to the Church of beleevers; And given ſo conſiderable anſwers to all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought by others to the contrair, a man of reputation) as <hi>Lockier,</hi> ſhould come forth with this poor one, that power was given to <hi>Peter</hi> upon confeſſion of his faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was given to him as a beleever, or under that reduplication, as if this were enough to daſh all, and in reaſon to convince all gain-ſayers.

Whence it is evident that in theſe words, <hi>Claves datae ſunt Eccleſiae, ut in actu primo, &amp;</hi> Petro, <hi>ut in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu ſecundo, Gerſon</hi> is not to be conceived to ſpeak of the Church denotating the body of beleevers only, as contradiſtinguiſhed from all Officers and Miniſters, and ſo is not ſpeaking of <hi>Peter</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending or repreſenting all Officers and Miniſters, but of <hi>Peter</hi> under the imaginary notion of a Pope or Head of the Church, and as ſtanding in contradiſtinction both to the body of beleevers and alſo to all Inferiour Officers and Miniſters, even conveened in a Councell, and ſo of the Church, as comprehending all Inferiour Officers and a generall Councell of them. And here, becauſe ſome are ready for the Independent Tenent, concerning the firſt ſubject of Eccleſiaſtick juriſdiction, to alledge the judgment of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Theologs, at, and after the time of Councells of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> affirming the Church to be that firſt ſubject, it is to be obſerved carefully, beſides that theſe Theologs, means not a particular Church, but the Univerſall Church; That the Queſtion which they had in hand with their adverſaries the Papaline flatterers, was not between beleevers as ſuch, and all Officers and Miniſters as ſuch, but between the Univerſall Church as comprehending Inferiour Officers, and that as conveened in a generall Councell, on the one part, and the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> on the other: Whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of Eccleſiaſtick power and juriſdiction, was ſeated in the Pope, or in the Univerſall Church ſo conſidered as we have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? This was the ſtate of the controverſie, and that for which the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Doctors ſtood, was the latter of theſe. This is clear to all that have read any of theſe Doctors Writings upon that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So that to alledge their Aſſertion concerning the firſt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream ſubject of Eccleſiaſtick juriſdiction, for the Independent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this Queſtion, which is between a particular Church of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers on the one part, as contradiſtinguiſhed from all Officers and Miniſters, and Officers of the Church upon the other, is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>

                     <hi>are ſuch Officers, who chooſe them to be their Miniſters in the Lord, and may depoſe them again, if they prove unworthy of ſuch a ſtation: Therefore have they no abſolute power over that Church, to which they are ſervants; but in the nature of guides, to direct them in the wayes of the Lord, and ſo long as they go right, to be honoured and followed; but if otherwiſe, to be admoniſhed; and if impenitent to be rejected,</hi> i. e. <hi>Excommunicated as they whoſe ſins follow after to judgment. Now ſuch judgment could not be exerciſed upon Elders, if ſuch an exempted power be taken to themſelves, without the Church, but might do what they pleaſe with the Church in which they are Servants, and the Church not able, at leaſt not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently able to do any thing to them; which is to make them</hi> Lords over Gods Heritage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is much imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency in the concluſion inferred, and in the antecedent bare Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, begged but not proven, and never will be: 1. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion propounded in the Aſſertion was, that the Elders in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church are not to exert power in moſt weighty maters, as admiſſion of Members, ordination of Officers, Excommunication, without the conſent and approbation of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> without the judiciall concurrence, conſent, and joynt authoritative vote of the members. Now that which is inferred as the concluſion here, that they have not an abſolute power over the Church, an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted power to do what they pleaſe with the Church, I appeal to all rationall men to give their judgement if this and that be all one. Why? May it not be that the Elders or Officers ſet over a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church may exert power in putting forth ſuch acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without the joynt authoritative conſent and vote of the members of that Church, and yet notwithſtanding, not have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power over that Church, an exempted power to do with the Church what they pleaſe? Yes verily: for notwithſtanding that, they may in their exerting of power of theſe acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1. Only act Miniſterially and adſtricted to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite rule over which they have no power. And 2. if they in their exerting their power deviat from that rule and act contrary to the direction thereof, the members may have liberty, upon diſcerning, by the privat judgement of diſcretion to refuſe obedientiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them. 3. And there may be an authoritative power over
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106774:117"/> and above them to which they may be countable, who may au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively correct and redreſſe their deviation, and to which the people may have recourſe for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ffect. And if ſo, then their exerting of power in the maters of Government tho without the joint judiciall and authoritative conſent and vote of the members therein, is not an abſolute power, an exempted power to do with the Church what they pleaſe. And ſo indeed it is in our Doctrine. The power it allowes to Elders and Officers to exert acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ent, without joint judiciall authoritative conſent of the members, is a Miniſteriall power adſtricted to a certain and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign rule of Chriſts Laws ſet down in his Word: It allowes to people a liberty, yea aſſerts it to be their duety, to prove in the judgement of privat diſcretion, if the Officers in their actings of Government deviat from, or croſſe the rule, or not; And in caſe they do, not to give their obedientiall conſent therunto: And that there is authoritative power above the Elders of a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Author deals not ingenuouſly enough, in inſinuating ſuch an aſperſion upon our Doctrine, that by it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Elders of a Church an abſolute power over the Church, an exempted power to do with the Church what they pleaſe. But now judge if the Independent way (in that ſtrain of it followed by our Author) be not guilty of giving a power very like this to members over Officers: When as it allows to the members, or the greater part of the members, of a particular Congregation (which may be 3. or 4.) to cenſure, depoſe, Excommunicat all their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers (which muſt be 3. at leaſt) by a ſupream Independent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without any Superiour Authority on earth left to have recourſe to for redreſſe, were their proceeding and ſentence never ſo unjuſt, this I am ſure is very abſolute, exempted, and lordly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like indeed. Well then, correct the concluſion as it is inferred here, and reduce it to the more modeſt and ingenuous terms of the Aſſertion.</p>

But to the two Texts of Scripture pointed at in it: 1. The former Act 11. 3. 'tis true, <hi>Peter</hi> there giveth an account of his going in to the uncircumciſed. But 1. was he required by a Church of Believers only and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed from all Elders and Officers (in which notion it is that Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> is now ſpeaking of the Church) to do this before them judicially? this is a dream: The Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom <hi>Peter</hi> was at that time, conſiſted of Elders as well as Believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>And the Apoſtles and Brethren that were in Judea heard, &amp;c.</hi> and it is well obſerved by the Nedder Dutch Notes, that under the name of <hi>Brethren,</hi> are comprehended the Elders, who afterwards, <hi>c.</hi> 15. 23. are diſtinguiſhed from private brethren, 'tis ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 2. that ſome of the Brethren contended with him for that deed, now, ſuppoſing that they challenged him judicially, and that he made his Apology judicially, how ſhall it be evidenced from the Text that he did it, before the body of Profeſſours, and not before the Colledge of Apoſtles and other Elders only, ſitting and cognoſcing judicially upon the mater? the ſharpeſt ſight in the World will not ſee a veſtige of any thing of this kind in the Text, nor can any man ſhew us either precept or example in Scripture for a Church of Believers alone judicially cognoſcing and giving ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of cenſure upon their Elders and Rulers. 2.

One Chriſtian doing any thing at which offence is taken, may and ought to give an account and ſatisfaction to another privat brother who is offended, for removing the offence: Yet hath not a privat Brother authority or power, judicially to cognoſce and paſſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon another Brother.</p>

If theſe be not tranſactions, more then meerly prudentiall, of very great generall concernment. I profeſſe, I know not what is.

But here by this Independent way, power is given to two or three Elders to propound the ſentence of Excommunication, which the fraternity are bound to joyn with as much as to obey their Preaching, and there is no ſuperiour remedy of judiciall recognition and redreſſe left to the party under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 4. If any maters of generall concernment wherein the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or hurt of every member is concerned, muſt be authoritatively tranſacted not by the Elderſhip alone, but by the members joyntly with them, I ſee not why all maters of generall concernment ought not to be ſo alſo: <hi>Magis &amp; minus non variant ſpeciem.</hi> But to come to the point wherin lyeth the proof of that, that it is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given and not taken when the members are offended, becauſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106774:122"/> they cannot by judiciall and authoritative vote, hinder the ſentence of the Elderſhip, the deciſive ſentence lying only in the Elders. If becauſe, in theſe tranſactions the benefit or hurt <hi>of every member</hi> is generally and greatly concerned; Therefore it is an offence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven if they have not ſuch power of judiciall concurrence and vote in the ſentence: Then I ſay women alſo muſt have this power and if they offend for want of it (as they are as ready as men to offend if they have not power to get their will) the offence is given and not taken; Becauſe women being members, are comprehended under that <hi>every member,</hi> and their benefit or hurt is concerned as well as mens.

If becauſe in theſe tranſactions, the benefit or hurt of every Member of the Church is generally and greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, when they are offended becauſe they cannot by judiciall and authoritative joint vote hinder the ſentence, the deciſive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof lying only in the Elders, the offence is not taken but given, and therefore they ought to have ſuch vote, then ſay I by as good conſequence, it followeth, becauſe in the great tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in civill Government, ſuppoſe, by a Major and his counſell, by a Parliament, the benefite or hurt of every member of the city or Common-wealth is generally and greatly concerned; If the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers offend that they cannot by joint authoritative vote hinder the ſentence, the deciſive power thereof lying altogether in theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, the offence is not taken but given; And therefore they ought to concur jointly and authoritatively in theſe tranſactions with their Governours. Here is again Levelling, backed with reaſon ſuch as it is. 7. Therefore to Anſwer directly, 'tis but a looſe and falſe principle, that in all tranſactions in which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite or hurt of perſons is concerned, all perſons whoſe the hurt or benefite is therein concerned, if they offend that they have not ſufficient ability to hinder ſentence, by their joint authoritative vote, the offence is not taken but given, and therefore they ought to have ſuch joint authoritative concurrence and vote. Nay it tends to the everſion of all Government and bringing in meer Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and confuſion. Yet 8. I think from this rightly underſtood may be inferred ſomewhat which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> would conſider in the mater of his next Aſſertion. For if all whoſe benefite or hurt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106774:122"/> is greatly concerned in Eccleſiaſtick tranſactions, ought to have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative joint concurrence in theſe tranſactions, then when as in ſome main tranſactions in a particular Congregation, for example Excommunication, many others benefite or hurt is greatly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, beſide theſe who are Members of the Congregation, it muſt follow that theſe others ought to have power of joint authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive concurrence in theſe tranſactions, or at leaſt ſome for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rereſt ought to have ſuch power. And this I conceive will amount to the overturning of the ſupreme Independent tribunall (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> calls it, <hi>Part.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) of ſingle Congregations; and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up an Eccleſiaſtick authoritative Judicatory over more Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>

SECT. 5. <hi>Becauſe the ſpirit of diſcerning both reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting perſons and things, is not conſined as a peculiar to the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery or Elderſhip of the Church—but the ſame gift may be in a great meaſure, in ſome of the Members, and a greater gift when all are joined together in the name of Chriſt and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them to diſcern and judge of a conjunct ſtrength of ſaints what mighty things and glorious are ſpoken in Scriptures? That they ſhall judge the world, Angels, much more able to judge their own affairs:</hi> This is the one part of this ſections Argument. There followeth another of which afterward. Now to this, 1. If this Argument hold good, then again Women, at leaſt ſome Women, ought to have judiciall concurrence and vote jointly with the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in tranſactions of Government. Why? the ſpirit of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may be in as great meaſure in ſome Women, as in ſome Men, and the greater will the gift be, when they with the Men are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and I think it will not be denyed that Women will be a part of the Saints who are to judge the World and Angels, 2. Upon the ſame ground, by proportion, it followes, becauſe many private men may have the ſame gift of diſcerning in a great meaſure, that is in Magiſtrates, in the Members of Parliament; Yea, may be, in a greater meaſure in ſome of thoſe then is in many of theſe, and there is a greater gift when all is joined together; Therefore all ſuch diſcerning men muſt have joint authoritative conſent and vote, with Magiſtrates, with the Parliament, in the Acts of Government. Here is again pleading for Levelling. 3. Becauſe ſome men, may
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106774:123"/> be, have as great a meaſure of knowledge and underſtanding for teaching the Word as Miniſters, it followeth proportionally, upon that ground, that ſuch men may and ought to Preach authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as well as Miniſters, and as Socinians, ſome Remonſtrants, and Separatiſts teach, a gifted man needs not an outward calling to be a Miniſter; His gift is a calling ſufficient. 4. To anſwer directly, to reaſon from a gift of diſcerning in maters coming under Acts of Government to actuall right and power to concur authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe Acts of Government, is a groſſe and palpable <hi>non ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Let a man never have ſuch a meaſure of a gift, for exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Acts of Government or publick authority, he muſt beſides, have the warrand of Commiſſion or calling to exert them, elſe if he take upon him to exert them, he is but an intruder, as all men will grant that are not againſt both Scripture light, and light of nature, and for turning all Affaires Civill and Eccleſiaſtick into a Chaos of confuſion. 5. Whereas the Author, ſaying, <hi>their wil be a greater gift when</hi> all (Officers and private profeſſors) <hi>are joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, (viz.</hi> in theſe Acts of Government) <hi>in the name of Chriſt and his preſence with them to diſcern and judge.</hi> We grant, that, when all private Profeſſours with the Church Officers, are joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, poſſibly there may be a greater gift of diſcerning, by way of aggregation then when the Officers are alone: But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as withall it is tacitely ſuppoſed, that all may meet in the name of the Lord (<hi>i. e.</hi> in his Authority) and may the more expect his preſence for aſſiſting the diſcerning &amp; judging in theſe maters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: in the former he begs the thing in queſtion, we deny that they do all meet for acts of Government in Chriſts Authority; and in the latter ſuppoſes a great miſtake, for the promiſe of Chriſts aſſiſting preſence for judiciall and authoritative diſcerning and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, runs not equally along with the gift of diſcerning ſimply; But with his calling and commiſſion to govern. That <hi>loe I am with you to the end of the world,</hi> as to Acts of Government, is not made to perſons having the gift of diſcerning, ſimply, tho never ſo many of them met together: But to perſons who beſide their gift, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with his Commiſſion. Therefore you muſt ſhew that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have a Commiſſion and Calling, beſide their gift, to exert Acts of Eccleſiaſtick authoritative judging: Or to ſpeak of expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106774:123"/> of the Lords preſence to aſſiſt their judging, let them be never ſo many, is to bid men preſume to act with expectation of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting preſence without a promiſe. There may be more of Chriſts preſence expected to aſſiſt a few having a Calling and Commiſſion from himſelf, in exerting Acts of Government; Then with a huge multitude though having gifts enough, but wanting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. If it ſhall be ſaid that private Profeſſours have a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to judge authoritatively with the Elderſhip in theſe maters of Eccleſiaſtick Government. 1. Then the <hi>medium</hi> of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is paſſed from, for it alleageth no more but the gift of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, to prove they ought to concur in authoritative judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. This is but ſaid and begged, not proven; Shew us the authentick grant of that Commiſſion. This much for the firſt part of the Argument in this Section, he addeth further thus.</p>

Anſw.</hi> 1.

See this aſperſion diſcovered and wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, before in our firſt SECT. and the Author in his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence knowes, may know, this is a wrong. Further, when Chriſt has by his inſtitution appropriat a power to a certain order (and he has, as to Paſtors and Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s, the ordinary publick authoritative Preaching of the Word, ſo to Elders in common the power of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline) for theſe alone to exert ſuch power, is no impropriation. But 2. To the Argument propounded here, I ſay 1. If it hold good, as in the former, it will follow that women muſt not be excluded from joynt authoritative concurrence in exerting power of Government
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106774:124"/> with the Elders more then men in the Church, Why? Women have their ſhare of the variety of gifts given to the Church, and ſome of them a greater ſhare then many men, and light may come in by ſuch a weak hand as a woman, when, &amp;c. And ſo all this help of their ſhare of gifts will be made void if the managing be committed wholly to Elders and other men in the Congregation, and they left out, only to ſee, &amp;c. And the very like Argument may, by proportion, be framed for admitting all privat perſons in a Common-wealth to concur authoritavively in the Civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with Magiſtrates. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the concluſion here. If the Elderſhip or Rulers of the Church exert power in theſe acts of Government, without the joynt authoritative conſent and vote of the people or other members, then the help which may be had to the whole, by that ſhare of that variety of gifts beſtowed by Chriſt upon the Church, which is in the other members, ſhould be made void. But this ought not to be, <hi>Ergo,</hi> nor that. Now I deny the conſequence of the propoſition, the ſhare of that variety of gifts given to the Church, which is in privat members may be of good uſe and help for the good of the whole, tho all of them do not concurre authoritatively in exerting or exerciſing acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church. May not privat members make their ſhare of gifts forth-coming and helpfull for the good of the whole, by obſerving, inſtructing, exhorting, admoniſhing, and provoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to good works one another, in the privat extrajudiciall way of charity? Ay, but it may be ſaid the help of theſe gifts in them to the good of the whole in the way of authoritative acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made void. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ſuppoſeth, that theſe gifts of privat members, are given to them by Chriſt, to be exerted for the good of the whole in the authoritative acting of Government, and that the authoritative actings of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

And this is to ſuppoſe, and ſo, to beg the thing in Queſtion. Yet further, we ſay the gift that is in privat members may be forth-coming to the good of the whole, which is to be effected by the acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Apoſtles and Elders are ordinarly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing names in Scripture, the latter ſignifying the ordinary, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, fixed Rulers in the Church. So that it muſt be but a devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fiction, to leave the ordinary notion of the word Elder, which ſignifies an Office diverſe from the Apoſtleſhip, and to take the Elderſhip here for an Aſſembly of Apoſtles. Nay we do not find at any time in Scripture the name Elder given to the Apoſtles, at leaſt never to them or any of them as Apoſtles contradiſtinguiſhed from other Officers.

For 1. If it ſhould be ſaid that <hi>Timothy</hi> was twice ordained: firſt to be a Presbyter, then to be an Evangeliſt, (as ſome Epiſcopall Writers ſay to be a Biſhop: but a Biſhop diſtinct from a Presbyter is a humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature not in Scripture) and the firſt to be that, mentioned 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. done by the ordinary Elderſhip; The ſecond mentioned 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. done by <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, an extraordinary Officer above an Evangeliſt; I know not what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> will bring to infringe this. 2. Suppoſing that he was but once ordained, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt and Elder both (as who ever was an Evangeliſt was alſo an Elder) yet an ordinary Elderſhip might concur with <hi>Paul</hi> in his Ordination, and the act of theſe ordinary Elders extend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to that which was common to him with other Elders, the Office of Elderſhip, that which was extraordinary flowing from the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> concurrence in the buſineſſe. In this mixt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we may very well diſtinguiſh, what was ordinary and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, aſcribing that to the Presbytery (<hi>viz.</hi> together with <hi>Paul</hi>) this to the Apoſtle. 3. Yet further I ſay with the worthy Author, I bring theſe things from, that I can ſee no inconſiſtency or abſurdity, if it be ſaid that the Presbytery ſent forth and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Timothy</hi> as an Evangeliſt: that it is alledged an Evangeliſt is an extraordinary Officer, and therefore the Elders being ordinary Officers could not give him a being, <hi>i. e.</hi> ordain him, I deny the neceſſity of the conſequence, any reaſon that can be brought to prove that conſequence muſt be, as I conceive, one of thoſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> Either, 1. That which is brought by ſome, from, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 7. 7. <hi>The leſſe is bleſſed by the greater,</hi> to which, as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in hand, that worthy Author has ſufficiently Anſwered, by two things Firſt, that altho <hi>Timothy</hi> as an Evaneliſt was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a ſingle Presbyter, yet that proves not that he was greater then the whole Presbytery, as one of the houſe of Lords is (ſure was) greater then one of the houſe of Commons; Yet not then the whole houſe of Commons, 2ly That he that bleſſeth is not greater then he that is bleſſed, every way: But <hi>quatalis,</hi> in ſo far as he bleſſeth, and ſo why might not the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106774:142"/> be greater then an Evangeliſt, not ſimply and abſolutely, but ſo far as they bleſſed and ordained him? That Author gives two inſtances of the like, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 17. and <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1, 3. Or 2. the reaſon of that conſequence muſt be this: Becauſe, ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers not having in themſelves that extraordinar office, can not give that which they have not. And if this be it, I would then aske M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier,</hi> how can people give the Office of a Miniſter which they have not in themſelves, nay, the Office of an Apoſtle, as he alledgeth that the people ordained <hi>Mathias</hi> an Apoſtle, whatſover he can anſwer for that will ſerve our turn for the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, ordaining <hi>Timothy</hi> to that Office, which they had not in themſelves. The truth is, mens ordaining a perſon to an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Office, not being by way of proper efficiency, nor yet the Ordainers acting therein as principal agents or conferrers of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (that is Gods part by his inſtitution) but as morall inſtruments under God: It is not, <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> requiſite, that the ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have in themſelves formally the Office, whereunto they Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the perſon; But it is ſufficient that they have a warrand from God to interveen as inſtruments to apply the perſon to the Office inſtituted by God. And I ſee nothing in the Office of an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt that can prove that ordinary Officers could have no warrand from God to act in this kind of cauſality to the applying of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to it.

The example which he referreth us to, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2, 3. we thank him for it, as making very much againſt himſelf: For albeit <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> the perſons on whom the act mentioned there, paſſed, did not then receive any new ordination, to an Office extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier,</hi> in a miſtake or inanimadvertency has imagined
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:106774:143"/> when he wrot this (they were Apoſtles before) yet did they receive a new call unto a more particular application, or as it were appropriation of the exerciſe of their Office unto a certain definit charge, the Gentiles to wit, as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf declareth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 7. and yet, we ſee evidently that as this calling was not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the body of the Church, ſo it was performed by ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Elders, I ſay not that it was by ordinary Elders <hi>only,</hi> for there were Prophets that had hand in it; But I ſay that ordinary Elders did alſo concurre in it, as appears, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>There were at Antioch certain Prophets and Teachers;</hi> I hope it will not be denyed that Teachers are ordinary Elders.</p>

And this ordination they acted alone: Therefore the Elderſhip, may do in moſt weighty things in the Church without the Church, without the joint conſent of the Church. Anſw.</hi> We bring not theſe places for the generall, that Acts of Government belong to the Officers of the Church, <hi>only;</hi> To wit, to act therein authoritatively. But, for this particular, <hi>ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Again the Author propounds the concluſion invidiouſly, <hi>without the conſent of the Church.</hi> We acknowledge that in theſe weighty matters the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the people, are to have a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall obedientiall conſent, but privat; The Queſtion is whether they ought to have an authoritative deciſive ſuffrage? And in the Calling of Miniſters they ought to have ſuffrage in their election: But as for the poteſtative miſſion, or ordination, that, we ſay, belongs to the Officers in the Church onely. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> It is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how the Author labours to cover the force of theſe places for proving of this, by ſlipping by the principall words, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. <hi>and ordain Elders in every City,</hi> and produces only the words of the verſes following, expreſſing the qualifications requiſite and to be preſuppoſed in the perſons that are to be ordained. In a word the argument from theſe places, is by him as ſlightly propounded,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:106774:143"/> as, I think, poſſibly he could. But let him take it thus. If ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Paſtours by Apoſtolick authority be committed to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Church as Officers, then it belongeth not unto the people. But the former is proven from theſe places. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Propoſition is clear of it ſelf. The Aſſumption is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Texts. Firſt, <hi>Timothy</hi> is charged to lay hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on no man in that ſame way, and under that ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he is charged, not to receive an accuſation againſt an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but upon two or three witneſſes teſtimony; And as he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to rebuke ſins publickly, that others may fear; and that he is charged to obſerve theſe other Rules given to him for ordering his adminiſtration in the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. But theſe things are a charge given to him as a Paſtor: So by what power <hi>Titus</hi> was charged to rebuke the <hi>Cretians</hi> ſharply, that they might be ſound in the faith, <hi>v.</hi> 13. By that ſame power was he left in <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders in every City. But this he was to doe by an Official power, and as an Officer, as is evident by comparing that <hi>v.</hi> with <hi>v.</hi> 9. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, here is an expreſſe Commiſſion to men in Office, to ordain, and charge laid upon them to be aware of doing it in a wrong way. Let the Author ſhow me in all the New teſtament, a Commiſſion given to people to ordain Miniſters, or a charge laid upon them to take heed how they ordain: But ſee we now the Authors Anſwers to theſe places.</p>

But it ſeems he has forgotten himſelf in ſhort bounds: for did he not, SECT. 8. cite <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 28. for direction in this matter?

The Author is pleaſed in his wiſdome to propound the Argument for evidencing this, as ſlightly as he could: But let him take it thus; That Government in the Church wherein, albeit there be ſuch as bear the name of Officers and Rulers, yet not only all the power of Government is placed in the body of the people as in the firſt and proper ſubject thereof, and not in their Officers; But alſo the whole body of the people formally and authoritatively, concur and act in the exerciſe of all the acts of Government, at leaſt all acts of juriſdiction, ſo that all maters of this kind, are caried and determined by the authoritative ſuffrage, conſent and diſſent of the people, nothing therein being left to the Officers as Officers, but to preſide and moderate the body of the people in their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative acting, or, may be, to prepare and ripen maters for their authoritative deciſion, and to be their mouth to declare the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>3</label> Now what anſwers the Author to this Objection? He brings us a number of words clouted up unhandſomely enough out of <hi>Hookers Surv. Par.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. which I think not worth the while to inſiſt particularly upon. Briefly, the ſumme of all comes to this: He tells us there is a power of <hi>Judging,</hi> to take in and to caſt out Members, to exert Office (he means to confer Office) or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade from Office, which he calls eſſential or fundamental power; And there is the maner of managing this, and exerting it: He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it alſo, To declare, act and exerciſe judgment in the name of the reſt, which he calls organicall power, and <hi>Poteſtas Officii particularis.</hi> And tells us that that former power is common to the whole Church Elders and fraternity: The latter is in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (yet I cannot underſtand how this can ſtand with what he ſaith, that <hi>it lyeth formally in one:</hi> But be it ſo) And ſo their (to wit, the Elders) power is diſtinctly uſefull and ſignificative. <hi>Anſ.</hi> To paſſe by here the exagitating of that diſtinction of a power eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and a power organicall (the abſurdity whereof in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy might be ſhown abundantly, might we ſtay upon every ſuch triffle) and other ſuch <hi>minutias.</hi> Here, to the main purpoſe in hand. 1. To talk of, and ſuppoſe a power of judging, in taking in and caſting out, inveſting Officers and degrading them, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:106774:145"/> to the people and alſo exerciſed by them formally, meaning, as he doth, of authoritative judging, is but a ſuppoſing and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the main thing in Queſtion. The place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. proves it not, Tho the Epiſtle be written to the whole Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> yet not every command and direction there relates to all and every one in that Church, as to act formally in the work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or required. We ſay that command of caſting out the inceſtuous perſon judicially reſpects the Officers of that Church only. See this made good by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rutherfurd.

M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Argument to the contrary, is weak; <hi>The Apoſtle ſayeth caſt out from among you. But the inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was not only amongſt the Elders, but among the people.</hi> What a poor Argument is this? Then it ſhould follow, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the Children ſhould judicially and authoritatively voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Excommunication of the inceſtuous perſon; For he was not only amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Apoſtle here, <hi>caſt out</hi> from amongſt you, tho Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in generall in the Epiſtle, yet in this particular command, muſt be underſtood to be ſpe king with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch in the Church as were inveſted with a morall capacity of power and authority to act that which he was commanding. 2. When he ſayeth the power of judging is common to the whole Church, Elders and fraternity, its but a fallacy as to Elders; For in effect Elders as Elders, by his way have no power of judging: As ſuch they have only the manner of managing the judgement. 3. When he expreſſeth the act of eſſentiall power (as he calleth it) competent to the whole Church, thus, <hi>Some to judge;</hi> and then the act of the Originall or Officiall power, thus, <hi>Some to declare, act and exerciſe that judgement:</hi> I would aske him what he meaneth by acting and exerciſing judgement? Either it muſt be the determining of the judgement; But that is nothing elſe but judging it ſelf, which belongeth to the eſſentiall power of the whole body: Or he muſt underſtand the execution of the ſentence, as for example, ſhunning the company of the Excommunicat; But that is no act of Office-power nor of authority, but is common to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106774:146"/> all the Church Men and Women: Or he muſt underſtand the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick uttering and pronouncing the ſentence of judgement: But that is juſt all one with declaring, and to call this acting and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of judgement, is very abuſive ſpeaking: Except theſe words be uſed otherwiſe in Engliſh Language then I know of. But 4. The chiefeſt thing I would obſerve is, that the Author in ſaying much to the objection propounded, has ſaid juſt nothing, but in effect yeelded it wholly. For when as he ſayeth that the power and exerciſe of judging, to wit, authoritatively (for of this, and not of judging by way of privat diſcretion is the preſent diſcourſe) belongeth equally to all the Church, and that the matter of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this only, belongeth to the Officers, what is this but as much as if he had ſaid in formall terms: 'Tis true, I yeeld it, the Government of the Church is Democraticall. And as for that he ſayeth, that ſeeing the Elders have in their hands the manner of managing the judgement, <hi>therefore their power is uſefull and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificative, and not uſeleſſe and nothing from the whole.</hi> True, it is not ſimply uſeleſſe and nothing ſignificative. But ſure I am it ſignifies nothing as to any power of Authority and Government. A Mr. Speaker or Preſidents part in a Parliament, a Prolocutors or Moderators in an Aſſembly, is not ſimply uſeleſſe and nothing, ſignificative, but it is juſt nothing ſignificative, as to Authority or Government.</p>

How the ſenſitive faculties may be ſaid to be all in the ſoul, originally, radically, and potentially, I can underſtand. The meaning being that the ſoul is the effective principle from which theſe faculties proceed by way of iſſue or emanation (as they call it) to have their ſubjectation or inherency in their ſeverall reſpective organs, and to ſay this is not incongruous. But how the ſoul can be ſaid to be in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>fundamentally, radically and potentially,</hi> I cannot well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. That the ſoul may be in ſome one part of the body as in the heart (which ſome) or brain (which others have thought)

This I can conceive, and it is not altogether incongruous to ſay ſo, though I think it be not true. But to ſay the ſoul, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſoul of man, is in the whole body; fundamentally, radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and potentially, is ſuch a ſoloeciſme (to ſpeak ſo) in philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, as I think we ſhall hardly meet with one groſſer amongſt men of any knowledge. For then, not only, does it follow that the ſoul muſt be by way of information, only in ſome part of the body (which tho falſe, yet is not ſo untollerable) but alſo that the whole body is the effective principle from which the ſoul is produced and iſſues by way of emanation, into that part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which it is ſuppoſed to inform: Now how abſurd this is in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, yea in Divinity, let any judicious man conſider of it. But yet I further wonder, that the Author, when he is expreſſing this his way of the ſouls being in the whole body, to wit, <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, radically, &amp;c.</hi> he brings for it that common ſaying amongſt the Schooles, <hi>totain toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte:</hi> For indeed that is the proper expreſſion of their Doctrine who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the ſoul is in the whole body, <hi>eſſentially</hi> and <hi>informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> and withall that it is in it as a ſpirituall forme, indiviſible, without extenſion of parts. But to paſſe this and to come to our preſent purpoſe. I verily think, Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> could not made choiſe of a fitter compariſon to make good and eſtabliſh the Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his way, which he pretends to anſwer, then that ſame he has pitched upon, and his own very words condemns him. He ſayeth the Church is to be conſidered as an organical body. So it is indeed, and this will make for us, as we have ſhown before. Next where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſayeth that it being ſo conſidered, <hi>the power of acting may be fundamentally and intrinſecally in the whole, and yet each or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan move orderly in his diſtinct place and way, as in the naturall body the ſenſitive faculties are in all the ſoul originally, &amp;c.</hi> To this 1. Suppoſe it were true that the power of governing were in the whole body of the Church fundamentally or originally, yet it can not be ſaid that each organ formally acteth the acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For governing being an organicall act in a politicall body,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106774:147"/> thence it ſhould follow that all the organes were but one organ, and the body of the Church were no organicall body; But a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar body: As, if each member in the naturall body did formally act <hi>ſeeing,</hi> all the members were eyes or one eye. And ſo, where were the body? To ſay that however that each member acteth in their acts of governing, yet each acteth orderly in his diſtinct place, <hi>viz.</hi> privat Chriſtians in their place, Elders in their place and ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yet this takes not away the abſurdity: For ſeeing Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> will have all and every one in the body of the Church <hi>formally and authoritatively</hi> to act in the acts of Government, it followes that all and every one of them are formally Governours and Rulers, the privat Chriſtians as well as the Elders, and there is no diſtinction between them at all, as to governing, except of meer order in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting. Certainly if all and every member of the naturall body did formally elicit the act of <hi>ſeeing,</hi> albeit that part of the body which we now call the eye, were ſuppoſed to act therein, in ſome reſpect, ſomewhat diſtinctly, as to order, from the reſt of the parts: Yet all the reſt of the parts were as formally and properly an eye, as it. Therefore as it were madneſſe to ſay that in the naturall body, each member doth formally act <hi>ſeeing:</hi> So it is exceeding abſurd, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Church to be an organicall body, and ſome of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes whereof it is compoſed, are rulers governing and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Lord, to whom ſubjection and obedience in the Lord is to be given by the reſt, and are as the eyes in the naturall body; Yet to ſay, that all and every member in the Church hath a formall authoritative hand or influence in the acts of governing, 2.

'Tis a very groſſe abſurdity to ſay that the ſoul is in the whole body fundamentally and radically or potentially, as we have ſhown before: It is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and by way of information in the whole body. 2. It is a groſſe inconſequence, the ſenſitive faculties are in all the ſoul, and the ſoul is in the whole body: Therefore the ſenſitive faculties are in the whole body fundamentally. Nay, they are fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and radically in the ſoul, and therefore are not fundamentally and radically in the body, neither whole nor part. But are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and by way of inheſion, in their reſpective parts or organs of the body. 3. I would fain know of the Author what he does make in the Church anſwerable to the ſoul in the naturall body, and ſo that wherein the power of governing is fundamentally and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as the ſenſitive faculties of the naturall body are fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and radically in the ſoul? Is it the whole Church as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending both people and Miniſters? That is the body. Or is it, the people? That is a part of the body. The truth is, Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> is at a loſſe here with his <hi>ſimile.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as King of the Church is unto the Church as the ſoul in the naturall body; And the power of governing is fundamentally and radically in him, and not in the body of the Church. And therefore, 3. to make uſe of the laſt words of his ſimilitude (for which we thank him as making clearly againſt himſelf and for us) as the ſenſitive faculties are radically and fundamentally in the ſoul, and act only (as he ſayeth well) by ſuch parts as are fit to act by, as ſeeing by the eye, and hearing by the ear, and the ſoul acts all its works by ſuch organs as are proper to each work; The hands to work the feet to go: So (to give the apodoſis which he had no will to expreſſe) Eccleſiaſtick organicall powers (ſuch as the ſenſes are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And in the ſecond he would ſo put them in the hands of one particular Congregation (may be, of ſeven or ten perſons: For of ſo many may a Church be compleatly conſtitute by their way) as that they ſhall exerciſe all that power, even to the higheſt acts thereof, Independently as the ſupream Tribunall in Eccleſiaſtick Government under Jeſus Chriſt, upon earth: So as that if there ſhould be any errour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by ſuch a particular Congregation, ſuppoſe the greateſt errour or hereſie in Doctrine maintained by it, or a man unjuſtly Excommunicated and caſten out of the Church, there is no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick authoritative remedy under Heaven to redreſſe ſuch an errour: No Eccleſiaſtick Judicatory, to which a grieved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may have recourſe, by appeal for Authoritative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition, or redreſſe of his grievance: But ſee we his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <hi>That Preſbyteries or Elderſhips without the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, exercing authoritative and coercive power over it, are an invention of man.</hi> Having thus propounded his Aſſertion, He explaines the ſubject of it thus. <hi>By Preſbyteries or Elderſhips without the Congregation, I mean ſuch an Elderſhip as is choſen out of ſeverall particular Congregations, aſſuming to themſelves, ſuperiour and deciſive power over them.</hi> Afterward he calls it
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:106774:156"/> forrain Elderſhip, SECT. 20. And ſo forth in the reſt of his Book. And then again undertaking to explain the nature thereof, ſayeth, <hi>I find among our Brethren themſelves that Elders and Brethren, ſent and impowered from their ſeverall Congregations, reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to tranſact, and conclude ſuch and ſuch Eccleſiaſtick affairs within ſuch a limited bounds, ex ſua poteſtate, are a forrain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbytery.</hi> A note or two upon theſe things and then we ſhall more clearly and diſtinctly ſet forth the true ſtate of the Controverſie, and what is our Doctrine therein. 1. Whereas he propounds to himſelf to Diſpute againſt the Authority of an Elderſhip or Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery <hi>without</hi> the particular Congregation, <hi>i. e.</hi> as he calls it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, forrain to the Congregation, he but enters in a conflict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own fiction. And whereas he ſayeth, SECT. 20. that he finds, amongſt their Brethren. (he means Presbyterians) that a Presbytery ſent from ſeverall Congregations is a forrain Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. I humbly conceive, for ought I can remember of any of them, he wrongs them exceeding much. I do not remember of any Presbyterian, that acknowledges the Presbytery of ſeverall Congregations aſſociat in Government, to be a forrain or extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall Presbytery, to theſe Congregations: Nor is it ſo indeed. It cannot be called a forrain Presbytery to all the Congregations aſſociat under it; Becauſe it is made of their own ſeverall Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips: Nor yet can it be forrain or externall to any of them; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every one is a part of it, and in it as a part of the whole. As a Parliament cannot be called a forrain Judicatory to the whole Kingdom whereof it is the Parliament, nor unto any of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Cities or Counties, which are parts of the Kingdom, and are in the Parliament by their Deputies or Commiſſioners, as parts conſtituents thereof. Indeed the Prelate and his Cathedrall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory taking to themſelves the Government and Juriſdiction over all Congregations in the Dioceſe were an externall &amp; forrain Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to theſe Churches, becauſe they excluded the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and their Elderſhips from all collaterall concurrence and copartnerſhip with them in the Government. But the Presbytery we ſpeak for, is made up of the Elders of the ſeverall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which it governs, as intrinſecall collaterall parts conſtituent thereof, and therefore cannot be called forrain to theſe ſeverall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106774:157"/> Congregations. 2. When as he expreſſeth the power of theſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries againſt which he propounds this diſpute, under the name of <hi>coercition,</hi> calling it <hi>a coercive power.</hi> He ſeemeth on purpoſe to choiſe an odious word, to render it ſuſpicious by the very name: For the word of <hi>coercing,</hi> in the common uſe, moſtly ſeemeth to import, outward bodily or civill force exerciſed upon perſons or things to ſtop and repreſſe their actions, <hi>ipſis etiam renitentibus,</hi> we aſcribe no ſuch power unto Presbyteries: But a power of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſpirituall cenſures which have no externall force upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yea nor Phyſicall neither, but only Morall, as adminiſtred by the Elderſhip: Tho they may be accompanied by God, With a Phyſicall (I mean a reall) operation upon the perſons, either in mercy or judgement. And if at any time thoſe who are for Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries over more Congregations, ſpeaking of their power, call it <hi>coercive,</hi> they mean no other thing, but a power of Spirituall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction exerciſed in Spirituall cenſures, ſuch as the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and theſe of his way, attributes to particular Elderſhips of a ſingle Congregation together with the Congregation over every member thereof. If the Author had dealt ingenuouſly with us, he ſhould not uſed ſuch a word without explanation of the thing, he knoweth we mean. But now let's ſee the clear ſtate of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie in this mater.</p>

Concerning which, there are ſome things, confeſſed and uncontroverted, where of we ſhould take notice in the firſt place that we may the better ſee where the difference and contoverſie lyeth. 1. 'Tis confeſſed by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren themſelves that conſociation of more particular Churches or Congregations in one Presbytery or Elderſhip is lawfull and uſefull <hi>Hooker Surv. p.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1, 2. 2. That theſe conſociations are and may be of ſeverall ſorts and degrees, ſome leſſer, ſome greater, Claſſes, Synods, and theſe Provinciall, Nationall, Oecumenicall, <hi>Idem, Ibid:</hi> So then there is no controverſie about the being ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Elderſhips and Presbyteries of more Congregations conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that they may lawfully be, and of diverſe ſorts is confeſſed.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106774:157"/> But there are theſe points eſpecially concerning them of which there is controverſie between us and our Brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>4</label> The 1. is concerning the nature of their power over the ſeverall Congregations or Churches conſociated in them. Our Brethren of the Independent way attribute no other power unto them but of counſel, &amp; perſwaſion to informe and hold forth unto the Churches what is commanded by the Word of God, &amp; to exhort &amp; perſwade them to their duty, to obedience of what they find commanded in the Word; But allow them no authority and juriſdictionall power to enjoine their determinations from the Word authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively under pain of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures. So M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker,</hi> in the forecited place, <hi>pag.</hi> 2, 3. 'tis true he calls this power of counſell, by the name of Authority. And ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> from him, Sect. 30. but an authoritative power of meer counſell, advice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion may be juſtly counted a Chimaera. But we ſhall not contend about names; Call it authority or power or what you will, the thing it ſelf is nothing elſe but brotherly counſell, which hath no binding force formally as iſſuing from the Presbyterie: But bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meerly <hi>vi materiae,</hi> materially in regard of the thing which is propounded by them, as it is a Scripture truth or command, as is confeſſed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker;</hi> And this is no more then one Brother may do towards another, and one ſiſter Church may do to another. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi> in the Keyes, <hi>ch.</hi> 6. ſeemeth to attribute more power to a Synod. <hi>They have</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>power not onely to give light and counſell in mater of truth and practice: But alſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and enjoine the things to be believed and done. The expreſſe words of the Synodicall letter imply no leſſe,</hi> Act. 15. 27. <hi>It is an act of the power of the Keyes, to binde burdens, and this bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power ariſeth not only materially from the weight of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters impoſed (which are neceſſary neceſſitate praecepti from the word) but alſo formally from the authority of the Synod, which being an ordinance of Chriſt, bindeth the more. For the Synods ſake.</hi> This in the letter of the words is a flat contradiction to what Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſayeth. He ſayeth they have only a power of Brotherly counſell M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Cotton</hi> not only that, but alſo to command and enjoin. He ſayeth they bind only materially, becauſe what they determine is either expreſſed in, or infallibly collected out of the Word:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106774:158"/> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton,</hi> not only <hi>materially,</hi> but alſo <hi>formally,</hi> from the authority of the Synode. Yet I conceive for all ſuch fair words, in the intention and reall meaning of the Author, little more is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood than what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſayeth, at moſt nothing more but a Doctrinall power, which is competent to any ſingle Paſtour as M. <hi>Caudrey</hi> ſheweth <hi>Vindiciae clav. c.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 53. We, on the contrare aſſert that by warrand of the Word of God, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of aſſociated Churches, Claſſicall or Synodicall, have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority of Spirituall juriſdiction, whereby they authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively diſcerne maters Eccleſiaſticall and impoſe theſe decrees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Eccleſiaſtick cenſures, and may inflict Eccleſiaſtick cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon the diſobedient and refractory in the particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations within the combination or aſſociation. Only let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved here, that this authoritative and juridicall power we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to ſuch Presbyteries of diſcerning maters Eccleſiaſticall, and impoſing their determinations under pain of cenſure, is not Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratorick and abſolute, binding abſolutely, by vertue of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; But Miniſteriall, and adſtricted in its determinations to the rule of the Word of God: So that that obligation formall which floweth from the authority of the Judicatory into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> preſuppoſeth that materiall obligation of the thing decreed, as contained in the Word of God, elſe it hath not place.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>5</label> 2. Point of Controverſie is, that the Independent Brethren doe not allow the ſtanding uſe of ſuch aſſociated Preſbyteries: But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſionall: We aſſert that by warrand of the Word of God ſome ſuch Preſbyteries are of ſtanding uſe as ſtanding ordinary juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall Eccleſiaſticall Courts. We ſay that Claſſicall Presbyteries, in the ordinary ſettled caſe of Churches are neceſſary ſtanding Courts for adminiſtration of Eccleſiaſticall Government, and alſo that Superiour Presbyteries, Synodicall, may be warrantably of ſtanding uſe where and when conveniently, moe Presbyteriall or Claſſicall Churches may have and injoy actuall combination, as of Yearly Provinciall Synods, as in the Churches of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are more frequent Provinciall Synods, and yearly Nationall Aſſemblies, as in the Churches of this Kingdome of Scotland.</p>
                  <p>3. Point is concerning ſubordination of leſſer Aſſemblies to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106774:158"/> greater. The Independent Brethren deny altogether ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Inferiour Aſſemblies to Superiour as juridicall Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Courts. Albeit they acknowledge that difficulties ariſing in a particular Congregation in matters of Government, there may be a going out to an Aſſembly of more Churches, and if need be, full ſatisfaction and clearing not being found there, there may be a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth yet to a greater and more large Aſſembly. Yet they ſay, that is elective and only by way of reference and arbitration, and only for counſell and direction, and aſſert, that a particular Congregation, is the ſupream Eccleſiaſticall Juridicall Tribunall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Jeſus Chriſt upon earth. So that a perſon although wronged by an unjuſt ſentence there (as they are not in their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons infallible) ſuppoſe ſentenced to Excommunication (which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him off from the benefit of Church Ordinances and fellowſhip of Chriſtians in all the Churches of the World) he may have no appeal from their ſentence to another Superiour Judicatory to have his proceſſe juridically recognoſced, and the injurious ſentence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded, but muſt ly under it without any Eccleſiaſtick remedy till death, unleſſe that particular Congregation be pleaſed themſelves to revoke their ſentence. So doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker</hi> tell us, <hi>Survey, par.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 40, 41, 43. and <hi>par.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 19. We, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, aſſert that both the Law of Nature, and the poſitive Law of God revealed in his Word, both in the Old and New Teſtament, holdeth out to us a juridicall ſubordination of leſſer Aſſemblies Eccleſiaſticall unto greater, ſo that appeals may be made from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour and leſſer, to Superiour and greater Aſſemblies, That it is both againſt the Law of nature and the poſitive Law of God to place a ſupream, Independent Eccleſiaſticall juridicall power in a particular Congregation, yea, or in any leſſer Aſſembly when as a greater and Superiour is to be had and may conveniently be had. We aſſert alſo that, that ſeries and gradation of this ſubordination which is acknowledged and maintained by Proteſtant Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> of Congregationall, Claſſicall, Provinciall and Nationall Aſſemblies is lawfull and agreeable to the Word of God.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>1</label> MR. <hi>Lockier</hi> undertakes by four <hi>mediums</hi> to prove that a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery having juridicall power and authority over more Congregations is but an humane invention. 1. Becauſe they are without a foundation in the Word. This he undertakes to make good by clearing theſe Scriptures on which ſuch Presbyteries are built: And brings in four Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 15, 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 35. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. So that his firſt Argument comes to this much in full matter and forme. If ſuch a Presbytery over more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had any foundation in the Word it were in ſome of thoſe four places: But in none of thoſe hath it foundation, therefore not at all in Scripture: But now tho his aſſumption were granted, and he did clearly evidence that in none of theſe mentioned places, it hath ſufficient foundation: Yet I muſt ſay, he does very groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſe his Reader (to ſay the leaſt) in his major propoſition. What, did never M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> read in Presbyteriall writers any other Scripturall grounds brought to prove ſuch a Presbytery but theſe 4. places, might he not at leaſt have read ſundry others? Let him read them over again, and I believe, beſides theſe mentioned, he ſhall find other grounds of Scripture brought to prove ſuch a Presbytery, as he ſhall never be able to withſtand the force of.

Did M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> never Read theſe grounds of Scripture urged in this matter by Presbyterians, that alledging here that ſuch a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery hath no foundation in Scripture, and taking upon him to make out this, by clearing ſuch Scripture grounds as are brought for it, paſſeth theſe in ſilence? If not, I wonder much he ſhould come to handle this controverſie, having taken ſo little pains to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his adverſaries grounds: Or if he has read them, why has he paſſed them by without an eſſay to cleare them.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106774:160"/> and that they acted as Apoſtles only, becauſe what they did any one of them might alone have done what they did? And therefore it is no wayes a patern for a Colledge of ordinary Elders acting jointly their ordinary power? But 1. tho it be true that they were together in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by Gods command waiting together for the powring out of the Holy Ghoſt: Yet it follows not, that by accident they did joyne in <hi>Collegio</hi> for that buſineſſe: Becauſe being together, by Chriſts inſtitution they were to joyne together in managing the affairs of the Church; They were bound and it was neceſſary that they ſhould do ſo. 2. True, what was done might have been done by any one of them alone; had they been alone: But it followeth not that, being all in one place, where they might joyn together, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> any one of them might do it alone: Nor does it follow either, that they acted as Apoſtles, becauſe any of them might have done it alone. Any of the Apoſtles might alone, by deciſive ſentence, determined the controverſie Synodically concluded, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. yet the Author will not for this, ſay, that in that buſineſſe the Apoſtles acted as Apoſtles The next thing I note, is a great miſtake of our mind concerning the nature of the Presbytery ruling over more Congregations then one. <hi>That it ſhould be a combination of appropriate Elders to ſeverall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, which theſe Acts</hi> 1. <hi>were not, but generall Officers.</hi> We do not think it is neceſſary to the eſſence of ſuch a Presbytery, that it be made up of Elders, appropriated to ſeveral fixed Congregations. We ſay, at the firſt where there were more Profeſſours then could meet in one Congregation, their Paſtours and Elders did teach and rule them in common, not being diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively appropriated to the ſeverall Congregations, and that yet in ſome Cities where there are more Congregations, it may be ſo, as it is at this day in ſome Proteſtant Churches: Tho we think, that now in the ordinary condition of the Church, it is convenient that Congregations be fixed, and have their ſeverall fixed Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Therefore we ſay further, what ever uſe be to be made of the preſent paſſage, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. in the Queſtion in hand, it is but a poor Argument the Author inſinuateth. There was not here concurring Elders of other Churches, this of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being the firſt and only Goſpel Church, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was not here a Presbytery ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:106774:161"/> over more Congregations then one, it doth not neceſſarily follow. For that very Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might be made up of ſeverall Congregations, nor can the contrary be proven; the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of names ſet down, <hi>v.</hi> 15. will not prove it, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demonſtrate that that was the whole number of Chriſtians in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

If only as Elders, thence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that all Elders have power not only to ordain men, but to erect new Offices in the Church: If only as Apoſtles, then hence is no warrand for any Elders, ſo much as to ordain men unto an office.</q> But I yet wonder ſo much the more at this Aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> here, remembering what he had delivered before, SECT. 10. where he drawes an Argument from ordination of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders performed by the Apoſtles for regulating the ordination of Elders in Churches now, and thereupon alledging (tho ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely) that the Apoſtles in ordination took in the people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with them, concludeth, that now alſo they ought to concur formally in that act. If they had acted as extraordinary perſons, as Apoſtles, the people could not concur jointly with then in ſuch an act, nor could it been an Argument brought as a patern in ordinary. Now if they acted not by their extraordinary office and power in ordaining Elders, what reaſon is there to ſay, that in the ordination of theſe Deacons, they acted in that way? 2.

Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtically, in caſe perſons, who have the reſult of things produced by them, do not follow them. They have as an Ordinance of God, a power of preheminent and prevailing counſel: That is, their reſult ought to be preferred and prevail more upon our hearts, then what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation other ſingle perſons, and ordinary helps, ordinarily afford. Anſw.</hi> Firſt here ere I come to the main buſineſſe, note ſhortly ſome few things. 1. We never attributed authority to a forrain Elderſhip, over any perſons or Churches. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> here ſaying that a forrain Elderſhip hath peculiar authority (if his meaning be according to his words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he underſtand authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) that is an Elderſhip extrinſecall to Churches, yet hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar authority over them, goeth farther then ever Preſbyterians did, and indeed goeth clearly contrary to truth, and in terms, ſpeaketh very like the Prelatick way, which attributed to a forrain Elderſhip, the Prelate and his Cathedrall, authority over all the Churches in the Diocaeſe. But indeed his words and his ſenſe agree not: For his peculiar authority, is no authority, as we ſhall ſee anone. 2. We ſay yet it is but an odious feigned deſcription of that power of juriſdiction, we attribute to Synods and other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated Presbyteries, when it is called <hi>a power to conſtrain their reſults to be practiſed,</hi> as we have diſcovered it before. 3. It is yet a groſſer miſrepreſentation, that we attribute unto ſuch Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries a power to <hi>cenſure perſons Eccleſiaſtically in caſe they have the reſult of things produced by them and do not follow them.</hi> Did ever any Persbyterian ſay ſuch a thing as this, that a Synod or Presbytery has power to cenſure perſons who have their reſults by them and does not follow them. For example, that a Synod in <hi>Scotland</hi> hath power to cenſure perſons, in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> that have their reſults by them and does not follow them, or that any Presbytery hath power to cenſure perſons of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of their aſſociation, who, may be, have their reſult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>13</label> But to come to the purpoſe in hand, Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> clear and plain anſwer, at laſt to this place of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. is that that Synod exerciſed no power of juriſdiction, but a power of counſell or advice only; He calls it indeed <hi>a peculiar authority.</hi> But when he makes it to be but counſell, that is to give it a bare name, for credits ſake; And to deny it the thing of that name. Counſell or advice is but an act of charity, and (if good) of wiſdom and prudence, and not of authority. 'Tis no other act but that which one man may do to a Church, one brother to another, one woman to another, yea as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> ſaith, <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> a maid to <hi>Naaman.</hi> That the Author ſaith it is a power of preheminent and prevailing counſell, that it ought to prevail more upon our hearts than the interpretation of ſingle perſons and ordinary helps, availeth not: For preheminent counſell is ſtill but counſell, and ſo that which is attributed to the Synod differeth no wayes from that which is competent to any ſingle perſons to do, or one ſiſter and equall Church to another, but only gradually. And ſuppoſe a company of Chriſtians, Paſtors or others met together, not Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, being perſons of known piety and underſtanding in maters of Religion, their counſell would be ſuch a preheminent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing counſell, that it ought to be preferred and prevail more with our hearts then the interpretation of ſingle perſons. So here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there is no peculiar authority, or power granted to that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, as ſuch an Ordinance of God. If yet it ſhall be ſaid that their counſell is preheminent and prevailing, ought to prevail more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only upon this ground, that they are many, pious and underſtanding men, and liker to find out the minde of God in his Word then ſingle perſons: But alſo becauſe they are ſuch an inſtitute meeting, a Synod. To this, I cannot ſee how Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> can ſay this, having but now told us that the decrees of the Synod bind materially, as being the will of God, but not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the reſult of the Presbytery. For what elſe is it to ſay, that their reſults ought to prevail more upon our hearts, becauſe the reſult of ſuch men as a Synod, but that they are binding formally as the reſults of the Synod. 2. If there be a preheminency or
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106774:166"/> power of prevailing in the decree of a Synod, ſo that there is an obligation upon our hearts to be more prevailed with, over and above that preheminency and power of prevailing which is in the counſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l of a company of pious and underſtanding men, met occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally not in a Synod, (which certainly ought to be preferred and to prevail more with our hearts then the interpretation of ſingle perſons) I would ask what is that different power, if it be not a juridicall power: and conſequently of cenſure upon diſobedience? For if it ſhall be ſaid it is not juridicall power, but only dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or doctrinall, then I ſay this is competent to every ſingle Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor; For a truth of the Goſpel taught and delivered by a ſingle Paſtor, ought to be beleeved and obeyed, <hi>i. e.</hi> bindeth to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and faith, not only becauſe it is Goſpel, but becauſe it is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally taught by a Miniſter, and ſo that preheminent and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power ſhall differ from the power of a ſingle Paſtor, but only gradually, and is the very ſame in kinde, and ſo no peculiar autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or power of a Synod, as ſuch an Ordinance of God. But now whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> aſſerteth that this Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 15. had not, nor did exerciſe a juridicall power, but only a power of counſell or advice: We aſſert the contrair, which is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proven by ſundry learned Writers treating upon this ſubject, and maintained againſt all Objections made to the contrair by Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites: We refer the Reader for ſatisfaction, to theſe, namely, Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy Aſſert. of the Govern. of the Church of Scotl.

                  <p>1. Is made up of two proceſſes, the firſt whereof is this. <hi>Theſe decrees are ſaid to bind theſe to whom they are ſent: But they were ſent to all the Churches of the Gentiles.</hi> This is evident ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier, Acts</hi> 21. 25. <hi>as touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written and concluded that they obſerve,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo, <hi>they did bind all the Churches of the Gentiles. Anſw.</hi> To this 1. for the Major, where is it ſo ſaid? I cannot remember any place of the ſtory where this is ſaid. If he and <hi>Hooker,</hi> from whom he hath this, mean, that we ſay and confeſſe this, that the decrees of the Synod bind all theſe to whom they are ſent, that we never ſaid; If it be underſtood of binding as Synodicall decrees. A Synod in one Nation may ſend their decrees unto Churches of another Nation (as was ordinary to do in the Primitive times) yet we ſay not, that the decrees of a Synod of one Nation, binds the Churches in another Nation, though, may be, the mater of them binds them. 2. For the minor: If the meaning be, (as it muſt be, that the Argument may ſpeak to the purpoſe it is intended for) that they were ſent by way of Synodicall decrees to all the Churches of the Gentiles (as certainly they were to ſome) we deny it, the place cited, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 25. proves it not: For it ſpeaks of the Gentiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitly, and clearly relates, to the Letter written, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. where the very inſcription bears, that ſo they were ſent only to the Gentiles in <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia v.</hi> 23. 'Tis true <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> delivered the decrees to others as they went through the cities, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. but it is not ſaid that they were ſent to them by way of Synodicall decrees, as they were to theſe other Churches. But grant that one way or other they were ſent alſo to the reſt of the Churches of the Gentiles, that is, that it was the will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Synod, that as occaſion ſhould ſerve they ſhould be delivered to them, and we ſhall alſo grant the concluſion of this firſt proceſſe in ſome ſenſe, that they did bind all the Churches of the Gentiles. See we what Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> will infer upon this in his next proceſſe.</p>

                     <hi>Now theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>(i.) all the Churches of the Gentiles had no Commiſſioners delegated to that Synod: Therefore what the Synod did could not bind them by way of authoritative juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe where is no delegation of Commiſſioners there is no</hi>

If he mean only that ſome of them had no Commiſſioners there, it is true, and we grant that the decrees of the Synod did not bind theſe Churches by way of juriſdiction and formally as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Synod, but materially. But hence it followeth not that they did not bind at all, nor any, by way of juriſdiction. For ſome Gentile Churches had their Commiſſioners there, and were Members of the Synod, <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> (theſe two laſt, if they had not, yet they might and ought to have had, and it is moſt probable they had) and ſo theſe Churches might be bound by them by way of juriſdiction and formally, for ought that is brought in this Argument, and they did ſo bind them as is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proven in the Authors cited before.</p>

The 1. is this. <hi>The decrees of a Synod bind only ſuch by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall juriſdiction, who delegate meſſengers to the Synod: But the decrees of this Synod bind more then theſe who delegated meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to it, to wit, all the Churches of the Gentiles. Therefore it did not intend to bind by Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction.</hi> Truely 'tis a pity to ſee a Godly man beguiling himſelf in ſuch maters, with ſuch illogicall ſillie Arguments. I will not ſtay to exaggerate this to the full, who ſees not the groſſe peccancy of this: And if the Author would have concluded formally and right upon his premiſes, the concluſion ſhould have been this: Therefore the decrees of this Synod did bind more Churches then ſuch as it did bind by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall juriſdiction. And this he ſhall have granted by us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction, but alſo without any advantage to his cauſe. His ſecond mould (which he ſayeth is more plain) is this. <hi>Theſe who ſend the decrees of the Synod to ſuch Churches who never ſent their Commiſſioners thither; They ſend only by way of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.

For as to the Major: The Synod which ſend their decrees to Churches who never ſent (at leaſt ought to have ſent) their Commiſſioners thither, ſend only by way of counſell to theſe Churches, true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: But if the meaning be, that that Synod which ſends their decrees to ſuch Churches as never ſent their Commiſſioners thither, ſend only by way of counſel to all to whom they ſend them, this is as eaſily denyed as it is affirmed: and I believe it ſhall be long ere we hear a proof of it. Then to the Minor, That this Synod of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſent their decrees to ſome Churches of the Gentiles that never ſent their Commiſſioners thither, let it be granted: Yet it is as certain, ſome, to whom they ſent them, bad their Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there as members.

But, 2. granting that the Scriptures doe teſtifie, that the ordinary Ruling power of Elders is not extendended beyond their ordinary power of Teaching (for that which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> addeth that the Scripture holdeth forth that rather the Teaching power exceeds in extent his Ruling po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, we deſire proof of it, for he brings none) we ſay that it is a miſtake which is alledged, that the Presbytery we ſpeak for, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over more Congregations extends the ordinary Ruling power of Paſtours beyond the extent of their ordinary Teaching power: It does only extend the ordinary exerciſe or <hi>actus ſecundos</hi> of the one, beyond the ordinary exerciſe or <hi>actus ſecundos</hi> of the other, having herein a call to the one and not to the other, which is no incongruity, nor doth oppoſe any part of the Word of God.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:106774:177"/> are matters of externall order and policy, which are determinable by the true light of nature, right reaſon, and generall Rules in the Scripture, about which is exerted that power which is called Diatactick; there are alſo tryalls and ordinations of Miniſters. Now I do not think that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> will take it upon him, to averre, that the Elders of a ſingle Congregation are like in reaſon to be more learned, and ſo more advantaged to judge in matters of this kind, then all the able choiſe men, Miniſters, and Elders from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations aſſembled together in a Synod, or in a Claſſicall Presbytery. 2. He inſinuateth alſo this ſuppoſition, that in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of Diſcipline about particular perſons there is no other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be cognoſced and determined, but Queſtions of <hi>meer fact;</hi> For, he ſpeaks of ſuch matters as are known and diſcerned by ſenſe, and whereof men are eye-witneſſes. This is another miſtake. For often times in ſuch buſineſſes are involved intricat Queſtions of Law or <hi>(Juris)</hi> as frequent experiences in the exerciſes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of Diſcipline, prove daily. As, ſuppoſe the phyſicall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or doing of an act alledged upon a perſon, as ſcandall, be found proven, for example, that he has eaten Swines fleſh before a weak beleeving Jew: Yet there may be this Queſtion of Law whether ſuch an act ſo circumſtantiat, be under the kind of a ſcandall: Upon reſolution of which doth depend the convicting of a perſon guilty of a ſcandalous fact. And again, ſuppoſe a perſon be found unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably guilty of a ſcandalous fact, yet there may be Queſtion of the demerit and weight of it in relation to cenſure: Now altho it be true, that the Presbytery of a particular Congregation is like to be more Learned, as to matters of meer fact in buſineſſes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members; Yet it can hardly be ſaid in reaſon, that 'tis like they will be more learned in Queſtions of Law involved therein, then many choiſe able men from many Congregations. 3. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuateth alſo a ſuppoſition that the Elderſhip of a Congregation being more learned or underſtanding in the buſineſſe of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (which yet can reaſonably be ſuppoſed only for matters of fact) that there can be no other ground of conveniency and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to bring their matters to be judged by a more ample Elderſhip over more Congregations; Which alſo is falſe: Where as a Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Presbytery or Synod is not like in judging to be ſo liable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall

And as for the learning and knowledge that the Elders of the particular Congregation have or may have in the buſineſſe of their members, more then other Elders, may not all that by them be communicate to a Claſſick Presbytery and Synod, themſelves being included in it as a part? 4. I adde but this, ſuppoſe the Elderſhip of a Congregation may be more learned in the buſineſſes of their members, yet I ſuppoſe (that which is not unuſuall to fall out) there may be differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Elders, or between the Elders and the people (who, according to Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> may have as much hand and more, in the juriſdiction, as the Elders) or both may be divided in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that nothing can be concluded amongſt them: What will you have done in ſuch a caſe? By all theſe may ſufficiently appear the weakneſſe of his firſt ground to prove that aſſociat El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips of more Congregations deſtroye and elude the end of Church power and Juriſdiction.

By Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> theologicall reaſoning here, the power at home in the particular Congregation of <hi>Antioch</hi> (if it was a particular Congregation, as theſe of our Authors mind may ſuppoſe it to have been) being an inſtitution of God for its own affairs, it could diſcern better, judge better, and heal better their controverſie then all the learned Aſſemblies in the world, and ſo then that at

But what if the matter to be diſcerned, judged and healed be not the particular Congregations own <hi>(i.)</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per affairs; but common, equally concerning other Congregations alſo. 3. But the grand, and I may ſay too, groſſe ſophiſme, here is a clear <hi>petitio Quaeſiti,</hi> a begging of the thing mainely in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that only the Judicature of a particular Congregation is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, and an aſſociate Presbytery Claſſicall or Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call is not of Divine inſtitution, unleſſe this be ſuppoſed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is null. One Ordinance inſtituted of God for one end doth not make void and uſeleſſe, another Ordinance inſtituted for that ſame end: But we ſay that an aſſociate Presbytery of more Congregations is inſtituted of God, as well as that of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation. The contrary of this, Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſhould have proven, and not barely ſuppoſed, and upon that ſuppoſition alledged that the power in the particular Congregation being inſtituted of God, ſhall do better then any Presbytery of that kind.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>1</label> HIs fourth Medium is, that a particular Congregation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and ſufficient in it ſelf without an aſſociate Preſbytery over more Congregations; Whereby he intends to prove ſuch Preſbyteries uſeleſſe and a device of man and no divine inſtitution, becauſe God would not appoint uſeleſſe things. His Argument fully ſet up is this: If every particular Congregation rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and compleated hath ſufficiencie within it ſelf to exerciſe all the Ordinances of Chriſt, to Ordaine, to Excommunicate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:106774:180"/> the larger Elderſhips, then larger Elderſhips are uſeleſſe; But every particular Congregation rightly conſtitute and compleat hath ſufficiencie within it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c. Anſw.</hi> Ere I reply particularly, firſt we would underſtand, what the Author doeth underſtand by the compleatneſſe of a particular Congregation, and what may be underſtood, by having ſufficiency within it ſelf to exerciſe all the Ordinances of Chriſt: for the former, I conceive the Author meaneth a particular Congregation to be compleat in its conſtitution, when as beſide, the body of private Proſeſſours, there is in it an Elderſhip made up of all the integrall parts thereof, Paſtours, or one Paſtour, Teachers, or one Teacher at leaſt. and ſome competent number of Ruling Elders, three at leaſt, ſo many Officers, according to our Brethren, make up a compleat Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for a Congregation. For the other we would conſider, that by ſufficiencie to exerciſe the Ordinances of Chriſt, we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not only a competencie of gifts and abilities of wiſedome and underſtanding for exerciſing ſuch and ſuch acts; But alſo, power and authority by a divine warrand, inſtitution and call. A private gifted man may have the competencie of gifts for Preaching the Goſpel, Adminiſtration of Sacraments, yet he hath not ſimply ſufficiencie to exerciſe that Ordinance, becauſe he hath not power and authority by calling from God to do it: Theſe premiſed, for <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The major Propoſition is a groſſe <hi>non-ſequitur,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the wiſdom of God in his Ordinances: for there may be for a certain end a mean appointed of God, which is by it ſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for effecting that end ſimply, and another mean appointed of God for that ſame end, and yet this is not uſeleſſe becauſe the other is ſufficient; Becauſe this may be for the better, more eaſie, more ſafe effecting of it. Manifold inſtances might be given of this, the promiſe of ſalvation or of the bleſſing of Believers, is of and by it ſelf ſufficient enough to give aſſurance to the Children of God of the immutability of Gods counſell and purpoſe of their ſalvation: Was therefore the oath added to the word of promiſe uſeleſſe. God forbid it ſhould be ſaid, it is added of ſuperabundant good will that we might have the more aboundant aſſurance and conſolation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18. So the Preaching of the Goſpel is of it ſelf a mean ſufficient of faith and ſalvation: Are therefore the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:106774:180"/> Sacraments, and Diſcipline, uſeleſſe? God has appointed, in his Church, means for his ſpirituall works therein, not only ſufficient but aboundant, not only for their <hi>eſſe ſimpliciter,</hi> but alſo for their <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> yea for their <hi>optimum eſſe.</hi> So that although a particular Congregation have ſufficiencie to exerciſe all theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, yet larger Elderſhips of more Congregations aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated together, may be of much and ſingular good uſe, for the better, or beſt performance or exerciſing of them, for exerciſing them with leſſe danger of erring and miſcarying, with the more authority, and to the begetting of the more reverence, reſpect and obedience in people. So Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> major which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects to prove, but ſuppoſeth as if it were without Queſtion, is rotten and falſe, and conſequently the whole frame of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by this fals to the ground, ſo that we need not inſiſt upon the minor or aſſumption: But 2. here I would ask M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier.</hi> What if a particular Congregation be not compleat, have not an entire Elderſhip of its own, I ſuppoſe, Paſtour and Teacher be removed, the Ruling Elders only remaining, or all of them being removed, in this caſe whether has the particular Congregation ſufficiencie in it ſelf to exerciſe theſe ordinances, to Ordain, to Excommunicate? If he Anſwer yes, as it is moſt abſurd and contrary to the Scriptures of God to make a Church exerciſing the publike Ordinances of Chriſt without the Officers and Miniſters of Chriſt: So, if ſo, what needed him propound the Argument of a Congregation compleat? If he Anſwer no; May not a Claſſicall Presbytery be of uſe here? Elſe how ſhall their ordinances be exerciſed to them? For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there will be a neceſſity of exerciſing ſome of them, of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at leaſt. But ſee the minor alſo,</p>

And gives for a proof of the conſequence upon that grant. <hi>If they may do the greater ſurely they may do the leſſer, and there is no diſpenſation of ſo choiſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency as Preaching, as Paul witneſſeth, making it the chief part of his errand. I was ſent to Preach the Goſpel, not to Baptize.—Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis true, we grant that ſuch a Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation having all its Officers hath ſufficiency in it to exerciſe theſe Ordinances of Preaching and Adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Paſtors of a particular Congregation may Preach the Word, and Adminiſter the Sacraments without ſpeciall conſent or help and concurrence, of the Claſſicall Presbytery to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act, nor were he to neglect or ceaſe from theſe, if the Claſſis ſhould forbid, I mean without juſt cauſe; Yet it may be, and it is ſo indeed by the warrand of Gods Word, that the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation cannot have, in the ordinary way of the Church in a ſetled and conſtitute ſtate, the Paſtor to exerciſe theſe Ordinances but by the conſent and poteſtative miſſion and Ordination of the Claſſis, or ſome aſſociate Presbyterie, and tho the Paſtor of the particular Congregation his exerciſing theſe Ordinances be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon the actuall concurrence in the ſeverall individuall acts; Yet therein he is ſubordinate to their Miniſteriall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to try and judge his Preaching according to the Word of God, and, if they find juſt cauſe, may forbid him to preach, and they forbidding, he muſt obey. But 2. Its a groſſe <hi>non-ſequitur,</hi> a particular Church, or the Paſtors in a particular Church, have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency or power to preach the Goſpel, and adminiſter Sacraments, without the help or concurrence of the Claſſicall Presbyterie. <hi>Ergo</hi> they may alſo exerciſe theſe other Ordinances, Ordination and Excommunication, without their concurrence; And the proof of it is invalide, becauſe that is greater, and if they may do the greater alone by themſelves, they may alſo do the leſſer: For by that ſame reaſon it ſhould follow, A Paſtor hath ſufficiency and power by himſelf alone to preach the Goſpel, to Baptize without the help and concurrence of his fellow-Elders in the Congregation.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:106774:182"/> 
                     <hi>Ergo</hi> he may alſo by himſelf alone Ordain and Excommunicate, without their help and concurrence. Why? That is the greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if he may do the greater alone, he may alſo do the leſſer. The Author himſelf will not, I conceive, admit the Conſequence here. The truth is, the intereſt of perſons to exerciſe this, or that, or the other, Ordinance is not to be attended or determined, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greater or leſſer excellency of the work: But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts commiſſion, inſtitution, and grant of power to them. The exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall power in ſome things, (which is commonly called <hi>power of order</hi>) as Preaching of the Word, Adminiſtration of Sacraments, is given to Chriſts Miniſters, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and a part, conſidered as ſingle Paſtors. So a Paſtor may preach the Word and adminiſter Sacraments alone, without concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or ſpeciall conſent, either of the whole Church, or other Rulers to every act: But in other things (theſe of the power, called the <hi>power of juriſdiction</hi>) the exerciſe and power thereof is not given to one, but to an <hi>unity:</hi> To the community of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church united together: not any ſingle Rulers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally. Therefore tho a Paſtor may preach, and baptize alone, yet he may not Cenſure nor Excommunicate alone; And if he ſhould do this, the act were invalide, both in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> and in <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Eccleſiaſtico.</hi> Now the power of Ordination and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation being given to a community, the Queſtion is, whether this community be a particular Congregation, having an intire par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Elderſhip, or the Elderſhip of a particular Congregation, by it ſelf and independent from a larger Presbyterie, this Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſaith, but his Argument, grounded upon our grant, to prove it, is impertinent, as we have ſeen.</p>

                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:106774:182"/> 
                     <hi>body, for Gods Worſhip have ability, a power given to it, as to ſuch an end</hi> (he means to exerciſe all the Keyes, alone and by themſelves, which he expreſſeth thus) <hi>they have not a lame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, part of the Keyes at their girdle, and ſtrangers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers carrying another part. Anſw.</hi> 1. As to that of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Keyes, we have ſaid ſufficient before. 2. As to that alledged, the Keyes were all given to <hi>Peter,</hi> as perſonating the Church of Believers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have ſpoken alſo before in the Examination of his firſt proof of the firſt Aſſertion. Now we adde but theſe things here. 1. I would ask Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> what he means by <hi>the Church of Believers in the Goſpel?</hi> Whether the univerſall Church Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Believers? Then he muſt acknowledge a Church Univerſall Viſible individually one: For certainly the article <hi>(the)</hi> denota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a certain ſingular one thing. But this, I doubt, Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> will grant, A Viſible Church Catholick, exiſting really one. And however: it is not his purpoſe here, to alledge that <hi>Peter</hi> received the Keyes, as perſonating the Univerſall Church Viſible. For the thing he would be at and muſt prove, is, that all the Keyes and exerciſe thereof are given to every one particular Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, ſingly and within it ſelf. If he ſay he means a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Viſible Church, I ask which is it, of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Corinth,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus?</hi> If any one of theſe definitely, what then becommeth of all the reſt? Nay but will he ſay, not any one particular Viſible Church definitely, but indefinitely any and every one. But 1. His words are, that <hi>Peter</hi> in this mater perſonated <hi>the</hi> Church Viſible, which in propriety of ſpeech, ſeemeth to me to note a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate and definite individuall, but paſſing this. 2. It cannot be a particular Viſible Church, whether definitely, or ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one: or indefinitely for any one; Becauſe, as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> himſelf ſayeth, the Church that <hi>Peter</hi> perſonated is that which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>that he would build upon the rock, that the gates of hell ſhould not prevail againſt it.</hi> But this is not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Viſible Church, but either the Church Inviſible of the elect and redeemed ones, or the Church Viſible Catholick; Becauſe any particular Viſible Church may be prevailed againſt. 3. That Aſſertion, <hi>Surely this particular here uſed</hi> (to wit, the Pronoun of the ſecond perſon twiſe in the ſentence, <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou) is not in vain,</hi>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:106774:183"/> but to ſet forth <hi>that every Goſpel Church,</hi> &amp;c. is, I may ſay, an Aſſertion of ſuch boldneſſe without proof, as any man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may wonder, that a modeſt man ſhould have uttered it, before men that have not ſold away their judgments to be ſlaves to any mans dictats. What? Muſt our Saviours ſpeaking to <hi>Peter</hi> here, in the ſingular number, be in vain, unleſſe hereby he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſet out every particular Congregation, and <hi>ſurely</hi> it muſt be ſo, and we muſt <hi>believe</hi> it ſurely to be ſo, becauſe Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſaith it, tho he do no more but ſay it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

And we make not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ground of this, that the Elderſhip of a particular Congregation, is not ſufficient (<hi>viz.</hi> for gifts and ability) for exerciſing theſe acts (although there be a ground of neceſſity of it ordinarly from this; It being ſeldome that in particular Congregations there will bee found Elderſhips ſufficient for managing theſe maters.)

From that which is ſaid by the men Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> diſputes againſt it, to wit, that Elderſhips of particular Congregations, when they may aſſociate with others have not ſufficiencie by divine warrand, to exerciſe acts of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of publike and common concernment, alone, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without the concurrence of aſſociate Elderſhips, much leſſe, without ſubordination to them, doeth not follow, that the Elderſhip of one ſingle Congregation, when there is but that one exiſting in the world, (ſuch as he ſuppoſeth that of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to have been at the firſt) Or if a ſingle Congregation, when though there be others exiſting in the Word, yet it is under a Phyſicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, by ſome inſuperable impediment, to aſſociate with others (ſuch as he ſuppoſeth theſe Congregations in <hi>Pontus, Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, &amp;c.</hi> have been) are ſo lame and imperfect, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in that caſe when neceſſity requireth, or may not exerciſe theſe acts. 'Tis granted in theſe caſes they may. Yet this we ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, a Congregation in ſuch a condition, though it be not in ſuch a caſe of abſolute imperfection, that it cannot perform neceſſarie acts of Government for its own preſervation, yet it is not in ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect a ſtate of Government, as when it may be and is aſſociate with others, for exerciſe of Government, this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to this reaſon. Onely 2. there is, one or two particulars would be noted. 1. While as he ſuppoſeth that the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:106774:185"/> was but one ſingle Congregation, if he mean all the time till other Churches in other places were erected, the ſuppoſition is beſide the truth, as has been proven by the Authors we referred to before upon this mater. Yet I doubt much if it ſhall be proven that at any time when there was a Government in it, that it was but one ſingle Congregation. 2. As to that he ſayeth of <hi>Antioch</hi> by that one Church wherewith it was aſſociate, I conceive that he means that of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but firſt how will he prove that it was not aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate alſo with the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> Sure there is great likely-hood that it was, at leaſt in that Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> conſidering that the Synodicall letter is directed to them and it jointly: again the very Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at that time at leaſt, was not a ſingle Congregation, but a Presbyteriall Church conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of more particular Congregations, as the Authors mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned have proven, and ſo was <hi>Antioch</hi> too.

In extraordinary caſes, to do things unordinary, I mean as to the courſe appointed by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive law, may be with very good ſatisfaction to a moſt tender heart, that is, a well informed and rightly tender heart, and not a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious heart: <hi>Have ye not read</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 4,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:106774:185"/> 5.) <hi>what David did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him, how he entred into the houſe of God, and did eat the ſhew-bread, which was not lawfull for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the Prieſts?</hi> It was an unordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing for <hi>David,</hi> or any other men, not Prieſts, to eat the Shew-bread: Yet in that extraordinary caſe, when <hi>David</hi> and his company were hungry, and no other bread was to be had, let their hearts be never ſo tender, if rightly informed, as they did eat, ſo with good ſatisfaction they might eat it. And generally what is not ordinarily to be done by a poſitive la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, in an extraordinarie caſe, when neceſſity requires, may be done, and a tender heart have good ſatisfaction in the doing of it, even in things divine. 2. The nature and conſtitution of Gods Ordinances is not eſtimat and defined according to what ſhape, the hearts of men are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he has put upon them: but according to what his own word ſaith of his will concerning them. It was yeelding to this aptitude of mens hearts in conceiving Gods ſhaping of Ordinances, that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing by private perſons, and even midwives, did ſpring from, into the Church of God. 3. The ordinary and expreſſe rule that we ſpeak of, that ſingle Congregations ſhould not exerciſe acts of juriſdiction of publick and common concernment, by themſelves alone without aſſociat Elderſhips, relates to the caſe when aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation may be had. But when aſſociation cannot poſſibly be had, as if a Congregation be in a remote Iland, or divided from all other Churches by ſome other inſuperable impediment of fellowſhip, we ſay that in that caſe of neceſſity, it is the ordinary rule to that Congregation to act as it is, alone by it ſelf: If it ſhall be ſaid, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when it is that way alone, it may exerciſe theſe Ordinances within it ſelf, then if, other Congregations being in a capacitie to be joined with, it may not exerciſe them alone, it is abridged off the former liberty it had before when it was alone by it ſelf. I anſw this is no abridgement of its liberty, but only a ſtrengthening of their power in things of common concernment; As, ſuppoſe there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five Elders in a Congregation, while as they are only theſe five, they may act in the Government of that Congregation. Yet if other fix be added to them, they may not now act without theſe, yet this is no abridging of any liberty they had, but a ſtrengthening
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:106774:186"/> of their power. The truth is, that a Congregation in an incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of aſſociation with other Congregations, exerciſeth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth all theſe Ordinances within it ſelf, not as being one ſingle Congregation, but as being the whole Church. A Congregation in ſuch a caſe, is as if there were not another Congregation in the world, and that is to be the whole Church <hi>interpretativè.</hi> Juſt as there being in a Congregation five Elders only, theſe five act all things belonging to Elders in the Congregation, not becauſe they are ſuch a definite competent number, but becauſe they are the whole number; Becauſe if they did act as being ſuch a definite number, they could not admit any moe to joyne with them in the work.</p>

But, 2. When as he ſayeth, that in the confeſſion of Presbyterians they differ only in extenſion, he miſtakes the judgement of the moſt part of all Presbyterians, who, and that indeed according to truth, hold that the power of a Claſſicall Presbytery, as to the exerciſe of Government, not only reaches a larger object, <hi>i. e.</hi> differs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, but alſo more acts of juriſdiction, as Ordination, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which the Elderſhip of a ſingle Congregation, as one

No wayes as has been ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before. Altho it were granted that the Elderſhip of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation may exerciſe all theſe ſpecificall acts, there may be many caſes, wherein it may be not only expedient, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the matter be judged and determined by an aſſociate Presbytery, as when it is a matter of great difficultie, when other Congregations are much and nearly, or equally concerned, when there is diviſion and difference in the Congregationall Elderſhip or Church that the matter cannot be agreed upon and determined amongſt themſelves, when there is an appeal <hi>propter malam adminiſtrationem, vel malam adminiſtrationem praeſumptam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Lord grant him mercy of it. 'Tis none of our pleading for the Presbyterian way, that many godly being in it, therefore ſimply purging of Presbyterian Churches, were more proper then rooting up and pulling down all. If any man, Sir, has come to reaſon with you, thus poorly for Presbyterian Churches, we doubt not but ere that time he has dealt treacherouſly againſt the truth. We tell you, the Presbyterian way, is Gods way inſtituted in his Word, the contrary whereof you, but beggingly ſuppoſe in framing your Objection, but has not, nor ever will prove. Yet this we affirme, that albeit there be in Churches, corruptions, not only in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of many perſons, but alſo in ſome things in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances, yet if they be not ſuch corruptions as everts and deſtroyes the foundation and ſubſtance of Religion: But there
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:106774:190"/> is therein, the ſubſtance of the Goſpel orthodoxly Preached, the Sacraments for their ſubſtantialls agreeable to their inſtitution, the way to be kept is, <hi>purge out the old leaven.</hi> And there is neither in Old nor in New Teſtament, warrand for ſeparating from, or pulling down and rooting up ſuch Churches. And as to that Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> alledgeth, that Presbyterians would have down Epiſcopall Churches: Either he has not underſtood or miſrepreſented Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians mind in that matter: Indeed Presbyterians were zealous to have the corrupt office of Prelacy plucked up, root and branch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a plant that God had never planted in his Church, and could not hear of a purging or circumciſing of it, that ſome would been at, by clipping from them officialls and ſuch other appendicles and limiting them thus and thus. But that the whole frame of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that were under Prelaticall government ſhould be razed down to the ground, pluckt up root and branch, caſt all in a heap of ruine, that out of the ruines thereof, their ſhould been picked out here and there ſome ſtones, to build up new Churches, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entered in the thoughts of ſome Presbyterians.

                        </gap>ſw.</hi> Verily S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, I am of the mind that any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man that reads your diſcourſe in this Section, will account it ſuch as is full of that which ye charge on others, weakneſſe and much worſe, I will not ſay the worſt that might be ſaid, but ſhall rather pray God to be mercifull to you in this matter, ſo blinded with prejudice and tranſported with paſſion, far otherwiſe then becometh a man profeſſing, to have the meek and wiſe Spirit of Chriſt. 1. If ſpeaking ſo broadly, he mean of Presbyterian Churches through the World (as indeed your diſcourſe here for pulling them down and ſeparating from them, runneth generally without any exception or limitation) that for their matter, three parts of four are naught, prophane atheiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What bold, and blind conjecturing is this? 2. If ye mean only the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that therein three parts of four are naught, prophane, atheiſts, both Elders and people: Yet I ſay, <hi>who art thou that judgeth another mans ſervant?</hi> No doubt many amongſt us are nothing ſuch as they ought to be, and it has been alwayes ſo for the moſt part, in Churches from the beginning: But that they are ſo many and ſo groſſe, prophane, atheiſts, both people and Elders, for a man that is a ſtranger to the moſt part of our Churches, Elders and people thereof, to pronounce ſo peremptorly, is more then he dare anſwer to God or his own conſcience upon ſecond conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat thoughts. 3. Suppoſe it were ſo indeed, that three of four in Churches, were naught, yet, ſuppoſing in Churches, there be the true Doctrine of the Goſpel Preached, the Sacraments, for their ſubſtance and eſſentialls agreeable to their inſtitution, the acts of worſhip for matter pure, muſt therefore, Gods people ſeparat from thoſe Churches, and the true Ordinances and Worſhip of God therein: Or muſt the Churches be pulled down, and plucked up root and branch? Shew us warrand either of precept or practice for this in the whole Word of God. Nay the ſtrain of Prophets, Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelf are clearly, as the Sun-ſhine, againſt it. How often was it ſo with the ancient Church, that we may
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:106774:191"/> ſay, more then three parts of four were prophane and naught? And yet did not the Godly and the Prophets of the Lord continue in the exerciſe of the Ordinances and Worſhip of God in that Church? Was it not ſo in the Church of the Jews, in the time of Chriſt being amongſt them upon earth? Did ever Chriſt for that require his Diſciples to depart and ſeparat from that Church? Or did he not himſelf, never a white the leſſe, continue in the Church communion thereof? Yea when in glory writing a Letter to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> of whom he teſtifies, that they had a name that they were living, but yet were dead, and that there were but a few names there which had not defiled their garments: Yet his wiſe and meek zeal is not for pulling down and rooting up and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the Church Communion in his Ordinances and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But that is his direction, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Be watchfull and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the things which remain and are ready to die.—Remember therefore how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> 4. But ſuppoſe that <hi>de facto,</hi> in ſome Churches the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of perſons Elders and people were ſo groſſe and abominably prophane, that there were no living for godly ones amongſt them, is this a good Argument to prove that the very ſpecies and kinde muſt be deſtroyed and plucked up root and branch? Unleſſe that Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> could ſhew that the way of Presbyterian Churches of it ſelf, in its very kind, allowes Churches to be conſtitute ſo, of perſons notoriouſly prophane, and atheiſts, that will not follow: But if he ſhall ſay this, we will avow it to be a ſlander. 5. When as he will have our Churches to be deſtitute of a right forme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not united by way of their Church-Covenant, but are knit together only by ſituation, and by forrain forenſicall El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips: And upon this account, will have them no Churches, but only carcaſſes of Churches. It is utterly falſe that we make ſituation or cohabitation in place or a forrain Elderſhip the form of our Churches. We ſay according to the Word of God, that the form which gives the being to the Univerſall Church Viſible, and unto every member thereof, is the profeſſion of, and entering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that generall Covenant with God in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and whereby every Chriſtian is oblidged and engaged to walk in all the wayes of God and perform all duties towards God, and other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:106774:192"/> in all their relations, required of them, according as God giveth opportunity and occaſion to perform and exerciſe them. As for Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Church-Covenant, diſtinct from that generall Covenant with God in Chriſt, as the form of a particular Church giving it the being of a Church, and right to the Ordinances of Chriſt, 'tis nothing elſe but a new device of men, having no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of precept or example in the Word of God either of the Old or New Teſtament: And his un-Churching of our Churches for want of ſuch a Covenant as this, is like many other things in this peece, has more boldneſſe in it then underſtanding or reaſon.

We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it is not lawfull to go on with any Church, in the practice of things that are corrupt in it. 2.

But daily and continually to go on in the exerciſe of a lawfull and neceſſary duty, in the company of wicked perſons, againſt whoſe wickedneſſe I do teſtifie, and does all that is incumbent to me in my ſtation, is not to mock or diſſemble, nor to do the thing I proteſt againſt: I am but a mere paſſive, or has no concurrence to the wickedneſſe of others.

                     </gap>. <hi>Lockiers</hi> words, a groſſe ſuppoſing or begging of the very thing mainly in Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That if wicked perſons be admitted to fellowſhip in a Church, as to the communion of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that the thing a Godly Chriſtian ought to proteſt or teſtifie againſt, is all joyning in the Ordinance when ſuch wicked perſons are joining therein with them: This is a very begging of the thing in Queſtion and utterly falſe. The thing the Godly ought to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and proteſt againſt, is the wickeds preſuming to abuſe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and the Rulers ſinfull permitting them ſo to do. But to ſay he does or ſhould proteſt that no Godly perſon ought to uſe the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:106774:193"/> Ordinance of God, or performe warrantable Worſhip, when wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons either thruſt themſelves in with them, or negligent Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers permits them ſo to do, is to ſuppoſe the thing in Queſtion, and is unwarrantable, yea contrare to the current ſtreame of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Godly under the Old and New Teſtament both, yea to the practiſe of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf in the Church of the Jews. To his ſecond exception. 'Tis true, in practicall things it is not ſo much a mans word as his practiſe which gives the diſlike. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is whether, the performance of a lawfull and neceſſary duty of worſhip, or exerciſe of a true Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, partaking of the Lords Supper to remember his death till he come againe, when and where wicked and ſcandalous perſons will thruſt themſelves in to do it prophanely, or are permitted by Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſo to do, be ſuch a practicall thing as I am oblidged to diſlike, as a thing unlawfull for me to do, this is the Queſtion, the negative whereof we hold to be the truth of God held forth in his Word. The inſtance produced by the Author for clearing this his ſecond exception, <hi>viz.</hi> of a man in an Idolatrous Church proteſting againſt the Maſſe, and yet ſtill going to Maſſe, is ſo groſſely and abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent, that one may wonder how it could be alledged, in this purpoſe, by an intelligent man. The Maſſe is even upon the mater one of the groſſeſt Idolatries that ever was in the world. And for a man to go to Maſſe, when he pretends to proteſt to go againſt it, is to adde, to commiſſion of Idolatry, mocking of God and ſinning againſt light profeſſedly. So that Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> needed not make it a mater of doubting how well ſuch a practiſe ſhould pleaſe God, or deliver the man from guiltineſſe. But what is this, to participating of a true Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt (for inſtance, the communion of the Lords Table) in a Church not Idolatrous, but may be, negligent and looſe in the exerciſe of Diſcipline, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting wicked ſcandalous perſons to participate in that Ordinance, when the Godly participating with them, teſtifies againſt ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe in the Ordinances? Nay, can it be freed, from great raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, (I will not ſay that which I might) to parallel theſe two together? But yet farther to bring in as a parallel to clear the buſineſſe, <hi>Naamans</hi> practiſing of heathniſh Idolatry in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> amongſt a people not ſo much as profeſſing the true
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:106774:194"/> God, but an Heathniſh people profeſſedly, denying the God of Iſrael, what will intelligent pious men ſay to this? To the third exception. Whether Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> defines proteſting well, to be a peece of revenge, the vehemencie of Repentance, let Lawyers judge. To my ſimple apprehenſion, proteſting, in the nature of it, has nothing to do with Repentance, as not importing guiltineſſe in the perſon proteſting, but being an act whereby he teſtifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſinfulneſſe and unjuſtice of the dead of ſome others, that he himſelf may appear clear and free from the concurrence in or the acceſſion to it, and preſerves himſelf in a legall capacitie to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it before a judge competent, but whereas Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that a man proteſting or teſtifying againſt the intruſion or admiſſion of ſcandalous wicked perſons, into the participation of an Ordinance of Chriſt or lawfull neceſſarie act of Worſhip, if he participate in that Ordinance or Worſhip, when and where ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons participates therein, that in this the man halts and halves, he does but beg the thing which will not be granted to him, and he will never prove. And on begged ſuppoſitions to ſay, <hi>how theſe will accord, is worthy deep thoughts of heart,</hi> favours of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Readers, if not of ſomewhat elſe. To the fourth, when there is a Proteſtation againſt the conſtitution and very being of an Aſſembly, 'tis true there is no ſubmitting to it by the Proteſters: But yet there may be a proteſting againſt ſome on or more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deeds of an Aſſembly when the conſtitution and being of it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and to ſuch an Aſſembly ſubmiſſion is not refuſed or denyed by any principles of ours: So there may be a proteſting or teſtifying againſt ſome particular abuſes in a Church, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion keeped with that Church in lawfull, true, neceſſarie acts of Divine Worſhip. But if the Author mean, that if ſuch an abuſe be in a Church, as that wicked perſons are permitted in it, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Communion, that in that caſe, the Godly muſt proteſt not only againſt the deed, but the very thing of that Church, as no Church, and therefore muſt not joine therewith, in warranted acts of Worſhip, but ſeparate from its Communion altogether, he will not have the ſimile of Aſſemblies and our cariage to them, to go along with him, and it is in it ſelf without warrand contrare to the warrand of Scripture, and we doubt not to ſay a moſt Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Aſſertion.</p>

The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is this, <hi>Doeth not Baptiſme give the forme of a true Church? and you ſay if the forme and foundation be right, it may be capable to purge it ſelf right.</hi> Sir, you are much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if you think that we hold Baptiſme alone to give the forme of a true Church. We ſay it is the initiall ſeal and ſolemne entry and admiſſion of Members into the Viſible Church, ſo this, is a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Objection brought in, it would ſeeme to vent a new conceit borrowed out of Mr. <hi>Hookers Survey, part</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. of a Church without Baptiſme, of which a word ſhortly upon his Anſwer to this Objection: Only here we ſay this, that which gives form and being to a Church is the true Doctrine of the Goſpel and Covenant of Grace, for ſubſtantials at leaſt, ſolemnly avowed by the ſealing of Baptiſm, and Preached by a lawfull Miniſtry (<hi>Lawfull</hi> Miniſtry. I ſay, as to the eſſentials of a Goſpel-Miniſtry) theſe three at leaſt are neceſſary to give the being of a Goſpel-Church. And where theſe are, tho there be many corruptions and defects in the Church, yet it is capable to purge it ſelf from its corruptions, and to ſupply its defects, and to urge unchurching of ſuch a ſociety, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, as no Church, or totall ſeparation from it, is not of GOD.</p>
                  <p>But come we to ſpeak a little to the Authors Anſwer to his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: <hi>Baptiſm</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth not give the form of Church memberſhip.</hi> So ſay we too: Profeſſion of the true Chriſtian faith is that which giveth the form of Church-memberſhip <hi>de jure,</hi> Baptiſm is the ſolemn ſeal thereof. But Mr. <hi>Lock.</hi> having in his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſpoken of that which giveth form &amp; being to a Church, how falleth he now to ſpeak of that which giveth form of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip? Is there no more requiſite to give form and being to a Church (we are now ſpeaking of a Church Viſible) but that which giveth form to Church memberſhip ſimply? This is a groſſe miſtake. Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> is that which adaequately gives the form and being to Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſimply. But to give form and being to a Church, there muſt be concurring with this, a Miniſteriall diſpenſation of the Doctrine
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:106774:195"/> of Faith and Ordinances, by ſuch means as Chriſt hath inſtituted them to be diſpenſed by. A Church exiſting without a Miniſtry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in the nature and being of a Viſible Church, is a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of in the Word of GOD. See <hi>Hudſ. c.</hi> 6. <hi>vindic.</hi>

Miniſters are before Baptiſme, and the Church is before Miniſters, for out of it are they made and have their keyes,</hi> &amp;c.

There was a Church without Circumciſion and without Baptiſm, when neither of them was yet inſtituted by God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> after Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was inſtituted to be the ſolemn ſeal of his Church, there might yet been a Jewiſh Viſible Church without it, and now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſme is inſtituted to be a ſolemn initiall ſeal of the Chriſtian Church, there may be a Chriſtian Church without Baptiſme: he might as well ſay that there may be a Chriſtian Church without the profeſſion and belief of that Article: JESUS the Son of MARY is the CHRIST, why? the Church was ſometime when there was no ſuch Article to be believed.</p>

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:106774:195"/> from Baptiſm, I profeſſe my ſelf one that cannot ſee. The Author would have done well to have aſſayed to ſhew us how that any way advantageth their Tenent; Indeed he ſayeth true, that Presbyterians are much againſt Anabaptiſts Doctrine. But would hereby, faſten a peece of dottage upon them: Becauſe that being ſo much againſt that Doctrine, they yet maintain a Tenet concerning Baptiſme, that much gratifies it, but let him aſſay to clear this, for it is not enough to ſay, <hi>any one may ſee it.</hi> What ground there is to looke upon his Tenet concerning the allowed matter of the viſible Church as tending to Anabaptiſm, we have ſhewed before in the 1. part of this Examination; But it ſeems to me, that in this place the Author does not a little gratifie the judgement of the totall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Baptiſm, and Socinians that accounts it needleſſe amongſt Chriſtians. While as he averres that there may be a Church (he muſt mean a Chriſtian Church elſe he ſpeaks not to purpoſe) before baptiſm, and that even before they be baptized, acting eminent Church acts, as making to themſelves Miniſters. If this, to averre that perſons may be a Church without baptiſm, and men may be Miniſters of a Chriſtian Church without baptiſm, if this Aſſertion be not advantagious to enemies of Baptiſm, I leave it to the Authors ſecond thoughts.</p>

But here 1. It may be juſt mater of enquiry to others, and haply may be of good purpoſe to themſelves to reflect and conſider, when theſe thoughts began firſt to be born in upon them, at leaſt when they began to out any thing of them. Did we hear any thing of ſuch thoughts in them, but ſince the late great revolution of State in this Kingdom, after <hi>Worceſter?</hi> and how ſoone thereafter did we hear of them by ſome of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although others thought fit to ſuppreſſe them ſome longer? This may ſeem to be ground of ſearching of heart, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:106774:199"/> above meaſure. 2. It ſeemeth by the Authors own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that the bearing in of theſe thoughts upon them at firſt has been from no good cauſe or principle; Not from the Spirit of God, unleſſe they will ſay, it has been by an immediate impulſe or Enthuſiaſme. For ſay they, it was after a long times ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them that they began to conſult with the Word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, for that is, as I conceive, to bring them to the ballance of the Sanctuary. 3. If implicitely they engaged themſelves to the maintenance of the Government deſined and ſettled in this Church, ſure then if they will reflect upon the nature and tenor of the engagement, they may find themſelves to have committed, in the very act, more ſin, than they inſinuate here, or I will name. For let them look back again unto the Nationall Covenant, and they ſhall find that they not only engaged themſelves to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Religion profeſſed in this Church in all the points thereof: But alſo declared and proteſted themſelves under Oath, after due Examination of their own conſciences in maters of true and falſe Religion, to be throughly reſolved of the Truth thereof by the Word and Spirit of God, and therefore to believe with their hearts, confeſſe with their mouth, and ſubſcribe with their hands. I do indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear that many did run unto that Engagement without ſuch conviction of mind upon clear warrand of Gods Word found by Examination of the maters. And as to do this with ſo ſolemne and dreadfull an atteſtation of God, that they did it upon conviction of conſcience, was horrible guiltineſſe: So it may wel be apprehended, that God in his holy judgement, has ſuffered many, for the diſcovery of the falſhood of their hearts (may be in mercy to ſome, may be in wrath to others) to revolt from theſe their former Engagements. I wiſh from my heart theſe Brethren (ſo I will yet call them, if they will yet be ſo called by us) if it be true which they ſay now, that they engaged implicitely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they proteſted before God that they did it upon through convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they would conſider this, lay it to heart, and yet againe bring their preſent way to the ballance of the Sanctuary. I have been with others witneſſe of ſome who having engaged in the cauſe of God in theſe lands, and caried themſeves therein for a long time reſolutely and actively, and having afterward foully lapſed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:106774:200"/> into contrary courſes, when they have been brought to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for their backſliding; Have declared that they found that their back-ſliding had ariſen from this, that their engaging in the cauſe at firſt and going on in it formerly, was not upon conviction from grounds of the Word of God, but implicitely and for by and extrinſecall reſpects. 4. It is not competent to me to queſtion, nor will I queſtion their diligence in ſeeking of God when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enquire about this matter (tho it be a thing uſuall now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, for men to ſet out naughtieſt wares with this inſcription <hi>after ſeeking of God</hi>) but as for uſing of all helps they could have to be cleared, I think ſome thing may be queſtioned: For beſides helps of mens Writings upon this purpoſe, might they not have uſed the help of the advice of the Judicatories of this Kirk and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the grounds of their doubting to ſome of them. Acts of Generall Aſſemblies require this, that before men vent any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in matters of Religion, they ſhould firſt peaceably repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Reaſons to the publick Judicatures: And albeit, they may haply ſay that the very matters they were queſtioning was the Authority of theſe Judicatories; Yet humility, if they had not overweening conceits of their own wits above the judgement of theſe Judicatures, and charity, if they had ſo much as they ought towards the Church, wherein they were born, baptized, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, ſome of them had been for ſome years Miniſters, and acting in aſſociation in the eſtabliſhed Judicatures thereof, might, it ſeemeth, led them to ſo much. But if they accounted the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures unworthy the conſulting with, might they not have uſed the help of conference with ſome of theſe precious and learned men, whom they profeſſe to reverence? If they did conſult with any of them before they were determined in the matter, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did vent their new judgement, is more then I know or can learn. But come we to their determination and the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>

                     <hi>So far</hi> (ſay they) <hi>as we can ſee, the Congregationall way comes nearer to the patern of the Word then the Claſſicall form.</hi> Here it may be asked why they ſay only that the Congregationall way comes nearer to the patern, and not ſimply that it is the way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the patern of the Word? What, does the Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:106774:200"/> way it ſelf come ſomewhat ſhort of the patern, and is there a third way diſtinct both from it and the Claſſicall, that comes full up to it? Is there here a reſervation for a further light? It may be we may hear ſomewhat of this ere all be done. But go we on to their deſinition or propoſition of the Congregationall way. <hi>To us</hi> (ſay ſay) <hi>it appeareth that Chriſt hath furniſhed a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with their Elderſhip with compleat power of Juriſdiction and cenſure within themſelves.</hi> There are here two things aſſerted by the Authors which accordingly they intend to prove by their two Arguments <hi>reſpectivè,</hi> afterward built upon the paſſage of Scripture which they cite. 1. That by Chriſts appointment the power of Eccleſiaſtick juriſdiction and cenſure is in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<hi>i. e.</hi> the body of privat profeſſours) and the Elderſhip joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (both being to concur formally in the acting thereof) and not only in the Elderſhip. 2. That any one ſingle Congregation with its Elderſhip has compleat power of juriſdiction and cenſure within it ſelf, ſupreamly and without ſubordination to any larger or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>yterie. But for further clearing of their minde here it were requiſit they ſhould explain theſe two things to us. 1. Whom they mean by the Congregation contradiſtinguiſhed from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, whether the whole collection of Church-members, or only men and thoſe of years of diſcretion. If the former, then Women and Children muſt be joint with the Elderſhip in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of juriſdiction and cenſures. If this be their minde we would know it and they would ſpeak it plainly. If the latter, then it is not the Congregation, but ſome part of the Congregation with the Elderſhip that has the power of juriſdiction and cenſure, or elſe Women and Children are not parts conſtituent of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: and then let them tell me where ſhall they find the name of the Church, in all the Goſpel in this notion, taken for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ale-profeſſours of adult years, excluding Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children? 2. Suppoſe the whole Elderſhip of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be ſcandalous and cenſurable who has the power of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and cenſure to exerciſe toward them? If juriſdiction and cenſure ſhould be exerciſed towards them (as I ſuppoſe it ſhould be) who has it, and who muſt do it? If ſome other Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Court, then ſhould not a ſingle Congregation have compleat
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:106774:201"/> power of juriſdiction within it ſelf, without ſubordination to any other Eccleſiaſtick Court in point of juriſdiction. If the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contradiſtinguiſhed from the Elderſhip, then the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone by it ſelf has power enough of juriſdiction and cenſure, and then what needed it be ſaid <hi>the Congregation with their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip?</hi> And indeed this is the way that ſome Independents goe: In their judgement the Congregation of privat beleevers, does chooſe, ordain and make their Elderſhip, and they may, cenſure, depoſe, and Excommunicat all their Elderſhip. So that theſe Authors when, intending a deſcription of the Congregationall way, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Independent way, they attribute the power of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and cenſure to <hi>the Congregation with their Elderſhip,</hi> if they mean (as their words ſeemeth to import, and they muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, unleſſe they minded to aequivocat) that the power of juriſdiction is given to theſe jointly, and not to either of them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, either they have not been acquainted with the mind of all theſe of the Congregationall way, or they have diſſembled, the latter of which, I have not reaſon to impute to all theſe Authors. The truth is the Authors of the Congregationall way are at a great deal of difference among themſelves, even to ſalt contradictions concerning the ſubject of the power of Eccleſiaſtick juriſdiction, as Mr. <hi>Caudry</hi> has evidenced in the place cited by us before, <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> Go we on to their probation of their Aſſertion. They cite one paſſage of Scripture firſt (telling us withall that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe other Scriptures, which they paſſe by: But I beleeve it ſhal be long ere they let us ſee them) <hi>viz. Mat.</hi> 18, 15, 16, 17, 18. and do build two Arguments on it according to the two things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in their Aſſertion. The former lyeth thus in their own words.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To paſſe ſundry things which might be noted upon this Argument and for brevities ſake to inſiſt only upon that which is materiall, the drift of this firſt Argument tends to the probation of the former part involved in the Authors Aſſertion, to wit, that the power of juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtick is not in the Elderſhip or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Church, but in the community of believers jointly with the Elders: and the weight of the whole Argument lyeth upon the ſignification of the term, <hi>Church.</hi> And all which is ſaid is but an old ſong that has been an hundred times daſhed by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and learned men already: See what we have ſaid already upon the ſame alledgeance by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier,</hi> above, <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. §. 2. and 3. For the preſent I ſhall ſay but theſe things on it. 1. When as theſe Authors ſay that in the New Teſtament the name of the Church is taken, ſometimes for the Congregation (<hi>i. e.</hi> in their ſenſe, the community of beleevers) with the Elderſhip jointly, ſometimes for the Congregation as contradiſtinguiſhed from El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſometime for a Congregation without Elders, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth that here, in this place it is to be underſtood in the firſt of theſe three acceptions, to wit, as it comprehendeth both Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Elders, I would gladly know, how, and by what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument they prove that it is ſo to be underſtood here, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one of the other two, for the Congregation as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Elders, or for the Congregation without El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For that we ſee only aſſerted by them, but no proof of it brought: Only this much they inſinuat, that it is commonly ſo uſed: But that will not prove that ſo it muſt be taken in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place. If they would aſſayed to bring any Arguments to prove that the name of the Church here muſt be taken, not for the Congregation as contradiſtinguiſhed from, or without Elders, but for the Congregation with the Elderſhip jointly; I doubt not but we ſhould found them all to be ſuch, as ſpeaks power of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:106774:202"/> and government in the Elderſhip as contradiſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the Congregation. 2. What though the word <hi>Church,</hi> be no where elſe in the New Teſtament uſed for the Elders or Governours of the Church as contradiſtinguiſhed from the body of believers; yet this is but a very weak Argument to prove that it is not ſo to be underſtood here, ſo be that the genuine gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſignification thereof be ſuch, as may well be applyed (as indeed the word anſwering to it in the Hebrew is frequently in the Old Teſtament applyed) to ſignifie a Colledge or Society of Judges or Governours as contradiſtinguiſhed from the people. See Mr. <hi>Hudſon. Vindic. of the Eſſence and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis ſome raſhnes in the Authors to call this ſenſe of the word a coined ſenſe. Even prophane Greek Authors have uſed it in ſuch a ſenſe, I mean for a meeting of Rulers. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> uſed the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concione magnatum.</hi> It is yet more then raſhneſſe, I may ſay it is a great impudency, that they ſay, it is <hi>without any colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> taken in this ſenſe in this place. Theſe Authors ſaid before that they have <hi>uſed all helps they could have</hi> upon this controverſie. Now let them tell us did they never read in any Writers upon this controverſie of Church Government, who expones the word <hi>Church,</hi> of the Elderſhip or Governours of the Church ſo much as <hi>any colour of reaſon</hi> brought by them for expounding the word in that ſenſe? How can they hold up their face and ſay this? Did they ever read <hi>Beza</hi> his <hi>Annot.</hi> on the place: Or, Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furds Peaceable Plea, c.</hi> 8. Surely the help of theſe Authors they eaſily might have had? Sure I am, if they have read theſe, to mention no moe, they might have found ſome <hi>colour,</hi> at leaſt of reaſon brought for the Interpretation. Nay, let them but read the latter of the two over again, &amp; I believe they ſhal find ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of reaſon brought for it, as they ſhall never be able to avoide. Verily whether we take the word Church here in a different ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from that whereby it ſignifies the ſocietie of Viſible Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans generally, comprehending private Profeſſours as well as Rulers, or not, yet that not all and every one comprehended under that ſignification otherwiſe, but only the Rulers are intended as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom the publike acts ſpoken of in the place, receiving of publike delations of ſcandals, and inflicting of cenſures does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:106774:202"/> is here invincibly demonſtrate becauſe otherwhere in the New Teſtament theſe acts, as all other acts of Eccleſiaſtick authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Government, are committed and attributed unto the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church, as ſuch, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20, 21, 22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 1, 19. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 13. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Heb,</hi> 13. 7, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2. and accordingly to them, as contradiſtinguiſhed from the body of Profeſſours, are given names importing Government and authority: But no where in the Scripture of the New Teſtament, ſhall any man ſhew us, either name or thing of Government gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to private Profeſſours. We proceed to their ſecond Argument whereby they would prove from that ſame place that any one ſingle Congregation with their Elderſhip has power of juriſdiction Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and Supreme, and to take away all juridicall Eccleſiaſtick Courts larger than, and Superiour to a Congregation, Claſſicall or Synodicall.</p>

To the Aſſumption or ſecond Propoſition, it ſeemeth theſe Authors have not well underſtood, or been acquainted with the ſtate and way of Presbyteriall Government ſettled in this Church, and therefore have been too raſh and haſtie in condemning it or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing againſt it, before they underſtood it. For 1. 'Tis not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe which they ſay, <hi>that the Claſſicall Preſbyterie is not the firſt Judicatorie to which appertaines judiciall cognizance of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, but that firſt they come to Seſſions, &amp;c.</hi> If this be meant Univerſally of all offences. Indeed, offences committed by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, ſettled members of particular Congregations, and as
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:106774:203"/> yet abiding within the bounds of the Congregation, comes firſt to the Seſſion or Elderſhip of the particular or ſingle Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But there are many offences the judiciall cognizance whereof comes not firſt to a Seſſion, but to a Presbyterie, yea may be a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, yea may be to the Nationall Aſſembly. When a private perſon having fallen into ſome ſcandalous ſin, and being conveened before a Seſſion, addes refractorineſſe againſt the diſcipline and obſtinacie to his former offence, this is a new offence, and the judiciall cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of this offence belongeth firſt to the Claſſicall Presbyterie. So a Claſſicall Presbyterie is the firſt Judicatorie to which belongeth the judiciall cognizance, Of an offence given by a Miniſter, in the Adminiſtration of his calling, Of an offence given by the Elderſhip of a Congregation (and indeed ſuppoſing the firſt part of theſe Authors Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the power of juriſdiction is given to the Congregation with the Elderſhip jointly, if they grant not an aſſociate Presbytery to take judiciall cognizance of their offence, they muſt exempt them from being ſubject to any judiciall cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance at all: For they cannot come under the judiciall cognizance of another ſingle Congregation) Of an offence wherein more ſingle Congregations are alike concerned, and many caſes more: I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that theſe Brethren did not rememher that the firſt judiciall cognizance, of <hi>James Grahames</hi> offence, of <hi>Seaforts,</hi> and many other publick Malignant wicked practiſes, was not by Seſſions, and from them came by reference to the Claſſical Presbytery, but by the publick Aſſemblies. 2. It is another groſſe miſtake too that theſe offences which comes to Seſsions or Congregationall Elderſhips to be judicially cognoſced upon, and from them comes to the Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Presbyterie, or to a Synode, that they come <hi>only by r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ferres from</hi> the Seſſions to the Presbyteries. For they come alſo by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of the party who is under the judiciall cognition of the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon mal-adminiſtration, or ſuppoſed mal-adminiſtration: They may alſo and do often come by way of authoritative viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seſsions and their proceedings by the Presbyterie.</p>

Suppoſe it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it ſtandeth, yet it could not make fully againſt us, to take away altogether aſſociate juridicall Presbyteries of more then one ſingle Congregation: Becauſe, as we have ſhewn upon the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:106774:203"/> ſuch aſſociat Preſbyteries or Eccleſiaſtick Aſſemblies, may be, and muſt be the firſt Judicatories, in many caſes, to which the judiciall cognizance of offences doth belong, But, 2. If the Major be taken in this ſenſe, the Church having power of binding and looſing is the firſt Judicatorie, to which, &amp;c. And <hi>it only,</hi> taking it with the excluſive note, as it muſt of neceſſity be taken, to infer that negative concluſion, <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Claſſicall or aſſociate Presbyterie is not that Church; We deny it as utterly falſe having no proof from the Text. We ſay here that the Church inveſted with authority to cognoſce judicially and inflict cenſure upon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences is the Rulers of the Viſible Church Univerſall, as joined <hi>in Collegio,</hi> or aſſembled, whether in the leſſer and Inferiour Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges or Aſſemblies (as a Congregationall Elderſhip is in reſpect of all others; a Claſſicall Presbytery, in regard of Synods; a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Synod in regard of a Nationall; this in regard of a Synod of more Nations, haply aſſociate for Government) to which as the firſt Judicatory matters may come for judiciall cognizance, or in larger and ſuperiour, (ſuch as is a Claſſicall Preſbytery in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Congregationall, a Synod in relation to a Claſſical Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to which, may be the matter cannot come at firſt or as to the firſt Judicatory having power of judiciall cognizance of it. 'Tis true, that in ſuch a caſe as our Saviour inſtanceth in the Text, when offence is given by one particular member of a Congregation ſingle and fixed in its conſtitution and proper Officers (which fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſingle Congregations under appropriated Officers, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by any divine inſtitution: For more Congregations, may be, have been, as it ſeemeth, in ſeveralls of the primitive Churches, and are at this day in ſome orthodox Churches ſerved by the ſame Officers in common without violation of any divine inſtitution) Chriſts command <hi>Tell the Church</hi> intends that the matter ſhould be brought to the Elderſhip of the Congregation as the firſt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature to which belongeth judiciall cognizance of it. Like as if the Congregation be not fixed by its ſelf in its conſtitution and Officers, that Command intends the bringing of the matter at firſt to an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip common to more Congregations. As alſo if the matter to be judged, be of publick and more common concernment then of one Congregation, that ſame Commandement, warrands by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:106774:204"/> and proportion, the bringing of the matter firſt to ſome more large Presbytery or Colledge of Elders, then the Congregational, as the firſt Judicature to cognoſee judicially upon it: But withall let it be ſo obſerved that when Chriſt inſtituteth this order, that offences when they cannot be removed otherwiſe, ſhould be brought to the Church, that is, to an Eccleſiaſtick Judicature, he ſayeth not, that they may not in any caſe proceed further for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall cognition and ſentence upon the mater, then to the firſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature to which the judiciall cognition of it belongeth; Nor is there any ground in his words, whereupon this can by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be inferred: In a word, there is nothing in this Text either againſt the juridicall power of larger Eiderſhips then Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſuch as are Claſſicall Presbyteries and Synods: Nor againſt the ſubordination of Congregationall Elderſhips, to the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and authority of ſuch larger Elderſhips.

Becauſe the power of Juriſdiction and Diſcipline Eccleſiaſtick there is inſtituted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Chriſt to be a remedy againſt all ſcandalls and offences in his Church; but all and every ſort of ſcandall falling out in the Viſible Church of Chriſt cannot be ſo remeeded or removed by the Colledge of Officers in a ſingle Congregation. They can only be a means for remedying and removing this way ſcandalls and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concerning their particular Congregation, and therefore there muſt be underſtood, as intended here by Chriſt, larger Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Aſſemblies and Judicatures to exerciſe Diſcipline and Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for remedying offences and ſcandalls which Congregationall Elderſhips cannot reach. 2.

P.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 14. 2. Suppoſe it did not exerciſe a criticall power, or power of cenſure, yet it followeth not that it had not a power of cenſure to exerciſe. On the contrary, the dogmaticall power of a Synod being of another ſort then the dogmatical power which is competent to a ſingle Paſtour, this being only concionall, and an act of the power of order, this is juridicall and an act of the power of juriſdiction, and of the Key of Diſcipline, it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth along a power of cenſure with it. Tho this be not alwayes put in actuall exerciſe when the other is: There may be, and ofter is need of a juridicall determination of a caſe by a Judicature, when there is not occaſion of exerciſing of cenſure by that Judicature, as is evident. 3. It is contrary to clear truth that all the power that Synod exerciſed is dogmaticall. For beſides their exerciſing a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmaticall power in confutation and condemnation of the Haereſie taught by the Judaizing Teachers, and vindication of the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great point of Juſtification by faith alone, without the works of the Law. They do alſo exerciſe a diatacticall power for healing the ſcandall of the weak Jews eſpecially, and their aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, from the Gentile Chriſtians who neglected their ceremoniall obſervances, by making and enjoining a practicall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, ordaining the Gentiles, to abſtaine from ſome things that might any wayes occaſion their offence. And alſo a criticall power or power of cenſure againſt the ſchiſme or <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

If people and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:106774:205"/> Brethren were in that Synod (as we deny not but they might be) their intereſt in the determinations and conſultations of the Synode was not by way of authoritative and definitive vote: But at moſt conſultative and by way of private conſent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as we cleared before againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier.</hi> 5. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of obedience to the acts of that Synode from the goodneſſe and benefite thereof, expreſſed in the cloſe of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodicall letter, doth not argue their conſtitutions not to have been made and enjoined by an authoritative power obleiging under ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of cenſure.

That they in explicating the Democracy they ſpeak of, ſpeak not of the power of ſingle perſons as to maters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but of ſingle or particular Churches. <hi>Singulae enim Eccleſiae</hi> (ſay they) <hi>parem habebant poteſtatem,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may eaſily and evidently appear, that while they ſay that the Government of the Church was much like a Democracy, they mean this, not to take away the Government out of the hands of Chriſts Officers of the Church, to put it in the hands of the whole people, at leaſt to joine theſe with them in the formall and proper actings of it; But in oppoſition to that authoritative and juridicall ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of any one particular Chutch over other particular Churches, as the Prelaticall men pleaded for authoritative ſuperioritie in their cathedrall Churches, over all particular Churches in the Diaeceſe, and the Papalins for an univerſall ſuperioritie and ſupremacie in the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:106774:211"/> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> over all other Churches in the world. 2. It is to be obſerved that among other things which they reckon up as parts of the Church Government which they ſay was much like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie, they put in, the Preaching of the Word, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacraments, which themſelves before ſay (and no man of ſound judgment will deny) are acts proper to the called Miniſters of Chriſt: Whence alſo, it is manifeſt that they mean not a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie properly ſo called, which putteth the formall power and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Government in the hands of all and every one of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which the Independent Brethren plead for. And indeed will any man conſider, what the particular Churches were, to which theſe Centuriators attribute private Synods (<hi>Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 130.) wherein it may poſſibly be conceived, that Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie could have place eſpecially, and it may eaſily be perceived that they were ſuch, as the whole body of the people (for whoſe right to concur in juridicall acts, the Independent Brethren pleads) could not poſſibly meet together in one, or be preſent at once, in their Synods when aſſembled for exerciſe of juriſdiction. For moſt part, at leaſt of them which they call particular Churches, were of ſuch amplitude, and ſo numerous, that ſuch an aſſembling of their whole body was not poſſible, and in truth they were Diae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan or Preſbyteriall Churches, and not ſuch ſingle Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Queſtion between us and the Independent Brethren concerneth. For mark it, in that very place laſt cited, ſpeaking of theſe particular Churches and their private Synods, they bring in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church for an inſtance: And who knows not how numerous the Chriſtians in <hi>Rome</hi> were become ere that time.
