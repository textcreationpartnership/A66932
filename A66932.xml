         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For my Å¿elf, I can Å¿ay in truth, it hath not hitherto been my ambition to increaÅ¿e wearineÅ¿Å¿e of the fleÅ¿h by much Reading: And that now I come this way to the worlds view, 'tis not of mine own meer choiÅ¿e, but becauÅ¿e a neceÅ¿Å¿ity was laid upon me. The Author with whom I have to do in this enÅ¿ueing debate, having not only opened his mouth to Preach in the
<pb facs="tcp:106774:3"/> most eminent-place in this Land, but alÅ¿o adventured to Write and Print againÅ¿t the Orthodox Doctrine touching the conÅ¿titution and Government of the ViÅ¿ible Church of ChriÅ¿t, revileing in Å¿peciall the Church in this Land (yet through its Å¿ide alÅ¿o Å¿tricking at all the Orthodox Churches in Europe) as no Church, but a dead carcaÅ¿Å¿e having neither matter nor form of a true Church; a neÅ¿t of unclean birds, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thereupon charging with a great deal of confidence and big words, all truely Godly to come out of it and to Å¿eparate from it. It was by Å¿ome Reverend and Godly men thought expedient, that (altho there appear little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in what is Å¿aid by him, which may brangle the mind of any judicious Reader: Yet becauÅ¿e it is a thing uÅ¿uall to adverÅ¿aries of the Truth, if what they Å¿ay, be it never Å¿o weak, get not an AnÅ¿wer, to brag of it as unanÅ¿werable; And unÅ¿ettled minds that have not their Å¿enÅ¿es exerciÅ¿ed to diÅ¿cern good and evill, are ready to be taken with any thing busked up with gay words, and Å¿o to be carried about, like weather-Cocks with every wind of Doctrine, as many Å¿ad examples of this time prove,) an AnÅ¿wer Å¿hould be returned to him, leÅ¿t truth Å¿hould Å¿o much as Å¿eem to Å¿uffer prejudice any way. And this taske they were pleaÅ¿ed to lay upon me. Who albeit I do, and cannot but ingenuouÅ¿ly acknowledge my Å¿elf one of the leaÅ¿t and weakeÅ¿t Servants of ChriÅ¿t, and that many others there are in this Church, who might far more worthily acquit themÅ¿elves in this Å¿ervice: Yet durÅ¿t not withÅ¿tand the motion, having Å¿o clear a Calling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idering withall how I Å¿tand oblidged, in my Å¿tation, to maintain the true Religion, in Doctrine, WorÅ¿hip, DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, by the mercy of God eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t us, in common with the reÅ¿t of the Lords people in the Land, by Solemn Vow and Covenant, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

               </gap>he truth, in a very gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with a Å¿trong hand, and in much long-Å¿uffering patience, whereby he waited to be gracious, that he might be exalted in Å¿hewing mercy on me.</p>
            <p>Haply it will be matter of talking to Å¿ome, that this of mine has been Å¿o long in coming forth after <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Lockier</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed his. But it is not unknown to many who have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es to my diligence, that my AnÅ¿wer was in readineÅ¿Å¿e within a few Moneths after his Peece came to my hands, and the task was laid upon me. And had come abroad if Å¿everal difficulties had not interveened,</p>
            <p>Now when it is to be publiÅ¿hed, I deÅ¿ire humbly to preÅ¿ent it to your LordÅ¿hip firÅ¿t, and under your Honourable name to the view of the world. I muÅ¿t Å¿pare to expreÅ¿Å¿e all the great cauÅ¿es oblidging me Å¿o to do: BecauÅ¿e to expreÅ¿Å¿e them would not only be, haply inexpedient; But alÅ¿o would be, I know, unÅ¿avoury to your Å¿elf, whom I have alwayes found deÅ¿irous to aprove your Å¿elf in reality of wel doing, but never liking well to hear of other mens <hi>euges.</hi> Only this much I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear and muÅ¿t begge your LordÅ¿hips leave to Å¿ay. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onall obligations which you have laid upon me by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tract of undeÅ¿erved reÅ¿pects, ever Å¿ince the firÅ¿t time I was known to your LordÅ¿hip, would require a worthier teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of acknowledgment, then is this mean preÅ¿ent, or any thing elÅ¿e my Å¿mall Å¿tore of abilities can afford. But to Å¿peak truth, it is not Å¿o much any perÅ¿onall concernment that hath engaged my heart to your LordÅ¿hip, as that which hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared you to all who know the truth and you: That grace which God hath vouchÅ¿afed upon you to walk in tenderneÅ¿Å¿e and cloÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e with himÅ¿elf in your privat courÅ¿e and with
<pb facs="tcp:106774:4"/> conÅ¿tant zeal to improve your publick Å¿tation wherein ye have Å¿tood, for promoving the intereÅ¿t of Religion and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and the good of Gods people without byaÅ¿Å¿e or wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in any revolution of times (wherewith many turning upon the axletree of their own Å¿elf-intereÅ¿ts, have whirled about) the Å¿weet fruit whereof, I doubt not but you find in theÅ¿e glowmie dayes, and truÅ¿t Å¿hall abide with you to the end, through the mercy of the Lord whoÅ¿e gifts and graces are without repentance.</p>
            <p>I will not adventure upon Å¿uch Å¿evere Å¿elf-denyedneÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿peak more of what I have had the happineÅ¿Å¿e to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, in your LordÅ¿hip. I hope this teÅ¿timony of my Å¿enÅ¿e of the obligation I ly under to honour your LordÅ¿hip Å¿hal finde favourable acceptance at your hands. <hi>I</hi> will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume (for indeed it were preÅ¿umption) to commend my work in it: I pretend to nothing therein, but that, through the Grace of God, I have ingenuouÅ¿ly and in Å¿implicity, tho in much weakneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿poken for truth: But the matter it Å¿elf is precious and of great weight, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of two great intereÅ¿ts of ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us his ViÅ¿ible Church, which is his ViÅ¿ible Kingdom on earth. The one touching the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the perÅ¿ons that are to be acknowledged members of his ViÅ¿ible Church, and Å¿o, in effect, comes to be a QueÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>de Å¿inibus,</hi> of the marches of his ViÅ¿ible Kingdom: The other touching the matter and way of the externall ViÅ¿ible Government thereof.</p>
            <p>As to the former, my Author has Å¿o Å¿traitned the bounds of ChriÅ¿ts ViÅ¿ible Church, that by his Å¿entence none are to be acknowledged as members thereof, and conÅ¿equently to be under the MiniÅ¿teriall diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ChriÅ¿t, the ordinary means of Å¿aving Å¿ouls, but Å¿uch as are already and antecedently found to be Å¿avingly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:106774:4"/> regenerated and Å¿ealed of God for his by the Holy Spirit, if not in the truth of the object (which yet moÅ¿t part of his reaÅ¿oning and diÅ¿courÅ¿e pleads for) yet in the poÅ¿itive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of very Å¿pirituall and diÅ¿cerning men: And that as Å¿ome others of his way further lay out the matter, upon triall and proof thereof given, by a converÅ¿ation led without the omiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of any known duty, or commiÅ¿Å¿ion of any known Å¿in: A publick declaration of their knowledge in the fundamentalls and of other points of Religion neceÅ¿Å¿ary to lead a life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Å¿candall, together with a narration of the experimentall work of their Effectuall Calling unto Repentance and faith: And all Churches that are not conÅ¿tituted of only Å¿uch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as this, are, to our Author, wrong conÅ¿titute. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this Examination, my labour is to diÅ¿cover the unwarrantablneÅ¿Å¿e and contrariety of this Tenent, to the Word of God; And to Å¿hew that all who being of years does Å¿eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly profeÅ¿Å¿e the ChriÅ¿tian faith, and Å¿ubjection to be diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd and governed by the Ordinances of ChriÅ¿t, ought to be admitted into the fellowÅ¿hip of his ViÅ¿ible Church, without any neceÅ¿Å¿ity of puting them to a triall touching their inward Å¿pirituall eÅ¿tate, and judging upon the Å¿ame whether regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat or not, as to that effect: And are to be dealt with, by PaÅ¿tours and privat ChriÅ¿tians in their reÅ¿pective wayes as theÅ¿e that are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> within, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. Upon this point I have inÅ¿iÅ¿ted the more largely, becauÅ¿e not Å¿o fully and of purpoÅ¿e handled by others before. And it is, of a truth, of greater importance then many are awarre of. 'Tis far from my thoughts to charge our Independent Brethren with any perverÅ¿e deÅ¿igne in taking up and following that opinion which I diÅ¿pute againÅ¿t. Many of them, known to me by their writings, eÅ¿pecially theÅ¿e worthy MiniÅ¿ters in <hi>New-England, Cotton, Hooker, Shepheard, Norton,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:106774:5"/> I do from my heart reverence as godly and faithfull Servants of ChriÅ¿t, and as burning and Å¿hining lights in the Reformed Church: But I think verily, the Å¿pecious notion of a pure ViÅ¿ible Church has duzled their eyes, and led them upon a way which in it Å¿elf, beÅ¿ide that it hath no warrand in the Word of God, Å¿hould it get footing in the world, tends to the ruine &amp; loÅ¿s of many Å¿ouls, and to the bringing of the greateÅ¿t prejudice to the preÅ¿ent CauÅ¿e and Churches, that any thing ever yet did Å¿ince the firÅ¿t Reformation from Popery: And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waded that, albeit the intention of thoÅ¿e holy and reverend men abettors of it, be honeÅ¿t and from Å¿implicity of heart; Yet Satan is under-board (let no man offend at this I Å¿ay, <hi>Peters</hi> example teacheth us, that Satan may abuÅ¿e good mens zeal and intentions for ChriÅ¿t to wicked ends, contrair to his CauÅ¿e) Satan, I Å¿ay, is under-board driving that wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne. For if that be the the rule and modell of conÅ¿tituting the ViÅ¿ible Church, which they give us, are not all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches by this means condemned of wrong conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp; razed out of the account of true ViÅ¿ible Churches, as not being conformed, nor ever having been Å¿et up according to that modell? And what could more gratifie the <hi>Roman</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriÅ¿t and his followers then to yeeld this? Again, is there not hereby a ground laid to QueÅ¿tion all AdminiÅ¿tration of Ordinances that has been in them, and to juÅ¿tifie the wilde fancy of Seekers, denying that there is, or hath been for many ages any Church or Ordinances in the world? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when as none of the Reformed Churches at this day are thus conÅ¿titute, if that modell Å¿hould have place, muÅ¿t not either all of them be diÅ¿Å¿olved and caÅ¿t down to the ground, that new ones may be reared up of Å¿ome few precious ones picked out of their ruines, or to the effect they may conÅ¿iÅ¿t only of perÅ¿ons regenerated and Å¿ealed by the Spirit, all other

That this is no needleÅ¿Å¿e fear, but a reall conÅ¿equent of this way, is too too clear, by the Å¿ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many in theÅ¿e times, who living without the pale of true ViÅ¿ible Churches and not Å¿ubject to the Å¿hepheards Å¿taffe and vigilancy, are run out into Å¿o many wilde errours in Religion as never age of the ChriÅ¿tian Church Å¿aw the like. Touching the other head, the Author in his Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix pleadeth for two things. 1. That the power and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e of Church Government, Å¿hould be in the hands of the whole body, or community of ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours as well as of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers appointed by ChriÅ¿t in the Church. A Tenent not heard of in the ChriÅ¿tian Church, untill <hi>Morellius</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> AnabaptiÅ¿ts, and BrowniÅ¿ts fancied it, and, as contrary to the Word of God (which to MiniÅ¿ters and other Officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by ChriÅ¿t in his Church as contradiÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from common ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours, attributeth the name of Rulers, injoyns the work of Ruling, and preÅ¿cribes the rules of right gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but never to the people) Å¿o cannot but unavoidably draw after it much confuÅ¿ion and frequent Å¿chiÅ¿ms in the Church of God, whereof experience affordeth plenty of examples. 2. That this power of Government Å¿hould be Å¿olely, intirely, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:106774:6"/> that beÅ¿ides the contrariety thereof to the Word of God and the very light of nature, carrieth with it a multitude of groÅ¿s abÅ¿urdities and inconveniencies. By this means let a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation of 30. or 20. or fewer, 10. or 7. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons (for of Å¿o few may a Church, as our Brethren Å¿ay, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly conÅ¿titute) run into never Å¿o groÅ¿Å¿e an errour, as to Excommunicate a perÅ¿on unjuÅ¿tly, to hold and maintain He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ie in Doctrine, to Å¿et up idolatrous worÅ¿hip, there is no EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick authoritative remedy left under Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it: All Church-communion amongÅ¿t the Churches of ChriÅ¿t is taken away: The unity of ChriÅ¿ts Å¿heep-fold, the ViÅ¿ible Church upon earth is diÅ¿Å¿olved, and ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould have as many viÅ¿ible bodies as there are particular Congregations: A MiniÅ¿ter could not perform any MiniÅ¿teriall act out of his own Congregation: Not Preach but as a privat gifted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Not AdminiÅ¿ter the Sacraments out of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, nor give the Sacrament to a member of another Congregation (as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair to thoÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿ertions, is my Å¿econd Part imployed for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the true way of Government which ChriÅ¿t has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in his Word, and in great mercy Å¿et up in this Church, to wit, by his MiniÅ¿ters and Officers, not Lording over the
<pb facs="tcp:106774:6"/> people of God in a Papall or Prelaticall way (as this Author either miÅ¿takes or calumniats) but MiniÅ¿terially under ChriÅ¿t the only Lord of his Church, Ruling them according to the Rule of his Word, in a way of rationall obedience: And that in a way of communion and aÅ¿Å¿ociation of Churches, and Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of leÅ¿Å¿er aÅ¿Å¿ociations unto greater and larger, as the Lord grants by his providence conveniency. On this I have not inÅ¿iÅ¿ted Å¿o largly as the matter it Å¿elf might affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded occaÅ¿ion of diÅ¿courÅ¿e. BecauÅ¿e it has been by learned and reverend men already Å¿o fully debated, the proofs of the truth Å¿o clearly made out, and all contrary Objections Å¿o abundantly diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed and Å¿atisfied, that I had little or nothing to adde: Yet I truÅ¿t I have through the Lords help, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, diÅ¿covered the inÅ¿ufficiency and invalidity of what is brought by this Author, who, I wonder much Å¿hould have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to preÅ¿ent the world with Å¿uch a diÅ¿courÅ¿e upon the mater after Å¿o learned labours of others, as are extant upon the Å¿ame.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106774:10"/> and no wayes deduceable from the words themÅ¿elves; the genuine purpoÅ¿e of the words being Å¿imply to note Å¿ome circumÅ¿tances of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and the other CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners joyned with them, their journey from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> whether they were Å¿ent for reÅ¿olution upon the QueÅ¿tion then in controverÅ¿ie at <hi>Antioch.</hi> As 1. The ChriÅ¿tian courteous reÅ¿pect that the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> put upon them, <hi>they were brought on their way.</hi> 2. What theÅ¿e commiÅ¿Å¿ioners did as they were on their journey: that they declared to the ChriÅ¿tians that lay in their way, that Å¿ame thing that they had declared before at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Chap. 14. v. 27. viz. that God had been mightily with the Preaching of the GoÅ¿pel even amongÅ¿t the Gentiles, Å¿o that many of them (as the Story rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the particular countries and places, Chap. 13, and 14.) were converted to the ChriÅ¿tian Religion. 3.

Here indeed are grounds of uÅ¿efull points of Doctrine: but what is all to that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> intends, the deÅ¿cription of a viÅ¿ible Church by its proper matter? A Church viÅ¿ible to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> is a particular Congregation participating together the Ordinances of ChriÅ¿t. Doth it any wayes appear that the Spirits intention in theÅ¿e words, is to deÅ¿cribe unto us what Å¿ort of perÅ¿ons were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the conÅ¿titution of Å¿uch a Congregation? viz. as he would have it, not any profeÅ¿Å¿ours whoÅ¿oever, but Å¿uch only as were tryed and found, by truely converted, and very Å¿piritual men, able to diÅ¿cern and judge, to be truely regenerate. What evidence is brought to Å¿hew that this is intended in the Text? This, to wit, that firÅ¿t it is Å¿aid, <hi>being brought on by the Church,</hi> and then, Å¿ayes he, <hi>what the matter of this Church is, the next words tells, they declared the converÅ¿ion of the Gentiles.

This, I Å¿aid before, I am not queÅ¿tioning now: but would diÅ¿cover the inconÅ¿ideratnes of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing and making uÅ¿e of this Text for that purpoÅ¿e, and adds but this: Å¿eeing in preaching the Word of GOD aright, any enunciative Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is propounded from a Text, if it ly not in the Text, in expreÅ¿Å¿e and formall, or equivalent terms, yet Å¿hould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable by good conÅ¿equence from it: I humbly deÅ¿ire that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> would build a clear SyllogiÅ¿me upon any enunciation in this Text, inferring this ConcluÅ¿ion, <hi>[the proper matter of a viÅ¿ible Church is converted ones]</hi> for in this Text it is not Å¿aid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿ly and immediatly, as he would Å¿eem to Å¿ay in the next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿e in theÅ¿e words: <hi>The complexion of a viÅ¿ible Church under the GoÅ¿pel is here Å¿aid to be converÅ¿ion: the conÅ¿tituting matter, converted ones.</hi> This much might Å¿uffice for anÅ¿wer to this Text,

This had been contrary to truth; for Å¿ome of the converted Heathens, no doubt, had no more but the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿tianity, the preaching of the GoÅ¿pel being as a draw net that catches good fiÅ¿hes and bad together, and the outward Kingdom of GOD, as a field wherein are tares and wheat growing together. Nor yet can it be Å¿aid that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in that declaration meant, that all and every one of theÅ¿e Gentiles they Å¿pake of, were Å¿uch, <hi>viz.</hi> true heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converts to their poÅ¿itive judgement, and Å¿o far as men truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106774:12"/> and very Å¿pirituall were able to diÅ¿cern. This appears not out of the words of the Text: for firÅ¿t, I think the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaks of ConverÅ¿ion as including gracious heart-converÅ¿ion, in the <hi>verity</hi> of the thing or <hi>Object:</hi> and not only in the <hi>charitative judgement</hi> of diÅ¿cerning men; tho not <hi>reÅ¿trictively.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockiers</hi> addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>According to what a ChriÅ¿tian can diÅ¿cern of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian, or in Å¿o far as men,</hi> &amp;c.] is his own and not the Texts; yea I conceive 'tis contrary to the intention of the Text: becauÅ¿e I no wayes doubt but the ApoÅ¿tles meant poÅ¿itively that there was amongÅ¿t theÅ¿e Gentiles heart-converÅ¿ion in the <hi>verity of the thing.</hi> But that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿ayes by his additament may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorily oppoÅ¿ite to that: men may be accounted heart-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in the charitable judgement of very diÅ¿cerning ChriÅ¿tians, and yet not be heart-converts indeed. 2. Granting that to be the meaning which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿aith to be, in his additament; yet can any thing be alledged from the words, that will import, it muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood <hi>univerÅ¿aliter de omnibus &amp; Å¿ingulis, i. e.</hi> univerÅ¿ally of all and every one of theÅ¿e Gentiles: and may not be underÅ¿tood as Å¿poken only <hi>de multitudine communiter &amp; indefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But Å¿ure I am 'tis to little or no purpoÅ¿e, for Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> purpoÅ¿e: For howÅ¿oever it be true that 'tis clear from this Text, that there was a work of effectuall Å¿aving grace amongÅ¿t theÅ¿e Gentiles Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and I do agree with him this far; that it were dangerous, yea moÅ¿t clearly falÅ¿e and contradictory to the words of the Text, to affirm that theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions might not mean effectuall Å¿aving grace; yet I Å¿ay firÅ¿t, that the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Peter</hi> was not here Å¿peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this work of Å¿aving grace, as the neceÅ¿Å¿ary qualification for conÅ¿tituting perÅ¿ons capable of ViÅ¿ible Church-memberÅ¿hip. 2.

For 1 I had ever thought it the received Doctrine of all Orthodox Reformed Divines, that the Churches of the Old and of the New TeÅ¿t are of one and the Å¿ame nature, as to eÅ¿Å¿entials; and that the difference between them Å¿tandeth in accidentals only. 2. Why do many of his way-bring Arguments for this his Tenet, touching the allowed matter of a ViÅ¿ible Church, from PaÅ¿Å¿ages of the Old TeÅ¿t. Å¿poken in relation to the then Church? 3. If the ViÅ¿ible Church in the dayes of the Old TeÅ¿t. might have conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of others, as allowed matter, then are deÅ¿cribed here (which his reÅ¿triction inÅ¿inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>perÅ¿ons not truly converted,</hi> &amp;c. then, to borrow his Arguments brought afterward. 1. Either ChriÅ¿t was not the Rock and foundation of that Church, and that Church not a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being and bearing upon him, as a Å¿uperÅ¿truction: or elÅ¿e then there might have been no Symmetrie, but Antilogie and AntiÅ¿taÅ¿ie; no agreement, but a fighting of the materials of the building with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106774:17"/> the foundation, and one with another: and yet the building might Å¿tand well enough, Å¿uch incongruous Å¿uperÅ¿tructions, and unÅ¿uite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the foundation, were good enough then. 2. Either that Church was not the Church of the living God, Å¿uch as in which God lives, dwels and walks: or then God did live and dwell in dead perÅ¿ons, who only make a ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of Religion: and then, either the Church was not a pillar and ground to bear up truth unto the world: or dead perÅ¿ons, who only made a ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of Religion, might have done that office well enough. 3. Then either in the Church of God there was none, at leaÅ¿t there might have been a true Church offering, and yet no <hi>pure offering,</hi> no offering Å¿piritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or then a pure offering, <hi>i. e.</hi> Å¿ervice Å¿pirituall, holy and acceptable unto God, might have been offered by perÅ¿ons who only did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e Religion, were dead Å¿tones, having nothing of Å¿pirituality in them, but meer formality: and Å¿o hypocriticall, and amongÅ¿t the number of them that are moÅ¿t abominable. Let the Author, if he hold that difference, intimated in his reÅ¿triction, between the Churches of the Old and New TeÅ¿tam. extricate himÅ¿elf of theÅ¿e things: which, I am much deceived, if he Å¿hall be able to do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e either he retract his reÅ¿triction, or otherwiÅ¿e Å¿hoar upon Å¿ome Socinian and AnabaptiÅ¿tick Fancy concerning the ancient Church.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>5</label> The third thing I would have marked in the Authors propoÅ¿all of his Doctrine, is this, that the judges by whoÅ¿e eÅ¿timation men are to paÅ¿Å¿e as the qualified mater of a ViÅ¿ible Church, are by him determined to be <hi>men truely converted and very Å¿pirituall.</hi> All Writers of the Independent way, have not, I confeÅ¿Å¿e, come to my hand: but of theÅ¿e I have Å¿een, I remember of none that Å¿aith this much: Å¿o that it Å¿eemeth to be a new conception of his own, touching which I humbly deÅ¿ire Å¿atisfaction in theÅ¿e particulars. 1. By this, when a perÅ¿on deÅ¿ireth to be admitted a member of a Church, it followeth that his qualification is to be judged, not by the eÅ¿timation of the whole Church, but of Å¿ome Å¿peciall members thereof: which is point-blank contrary to the Independent way of Government. The conÅ¿equence I prove. 1. thus: Either it muÅ¿t be Å¿aid that all and every one of the Church are truely converted <hi>de facto:</hi> or if that be not Å¿aid, this which we have Å¿aid doth una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follow: but the former will not be undertaken by the Author; becauÅ¿e it is point-blank contrary to plain Scripture, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us that many are called but few choÅ¿en: and this is confeÅ¿Å¿ed by Å¿uch as are moÅ¿t peremptory for his way of Church conÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="*" place="margin">

I prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equence thus: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿peaketh of Å¿uch men to be Judges, as are not only truely converted, but alÅ¿o <hi>very Å¿pirituall.</hi> Now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿pirituall importeth, I conceive, in plain EngliÅ¿h, if not a Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative degree, yet certainly Å¿omewhat above the meer poÅ¿itive; to be very Å¿pirituall, is more, yea much more then Å¿imply to be really and truely Å¿pirituall: So that either he muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity Å¿ay
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106774:18"/> that a ViÅ¿ible Church muÅ¿t conÅ¿iÅ¿t of Å¿uch only, who are not only, Å¿imply true converts; but alÅ¿o much more, far advanced ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and Å¿o new born Babes, bruiÅ¿ed reeds, and Å¿moaking flax, muÅ¿t be held out, cruÅ¿hed, and quenched; or that which we Å¿aid muÅ¿t follow. Now I Å¿uppoÅ¿e yet further that moÅ¿t part of the Congregation be Å¿pirituall, but in the <hi>poÅ¿itive degree,</hi> and onely two or three, or a few number in compariÅ¿on, be <hi>very Å¿piritual</hi> (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this may be by our Brethrens way of conÅ¿tituting a Church: for they grant Å¿uch as have any thing, the leaÅ¿t thing in truth of ChriÅ¿t appearing in them, are not to be excluded) then the reÅ¿olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judging of the whole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, muÅ¿t be devolved upon theÅ¿e few. Nay I muÅ¿t preÅ¿Å¿e it yet further: Albeit it may be granted that when a Church is now compleatly conÅ¿titute in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrality, and organized with all its members, it cannot be well Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed, but there will be therein Å¿ome Å¿uch men, <hi>very Å¿pirituall;</hi> at leaÅ¿t Rulers; whom if Å¿o be they had not of themÅ¿elves, while they were yet a gathering, yet it may well be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, that while they are yet but a gathering, all of them are but Å¿pirituall in the poÅ¿itive degree. For what hinders, but Å¿uch a company of perÅ¿ons may come together to gather into a Church? Now, I pray, what Å¿hall be done in this caÅ¿e, if Church-mater in point of fitneÅ¿Å¿e muÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿e by the eÅ¿timation of men, more then poÅ¿itive in Å¿piritualitie? MuÅ¿t it be Å¿aid in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e that though they be all Å¿atisfied in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience concerning the truth of one anothers converÅ¿ion, Yet they are not fit mater to make themÅ¿elves a Church? I would Å¿ee Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or Å¿hadow of reaÅ¿on for this. Yea it appeareth contrary to Å¿ound reaÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e in homogeneall bodies (Å¿uch as a Church is, by the Doctrine of our Brethren, in the inÅ¿tance and period we are now Å¿peaking to) what is Å¿ufficient to conÅ¿titute a part, is Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient alÅ¿o to conÅ¿titute the whole. Therefore if ConverÅ¿ion and Å¿piritualneÅ¿Å¿e in the poÅ¿itive degree, be Å¿ufficient for one member of the ViÅ¿ible Church, its Å¿ufficient alÅ¿o for the whole, I mean, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered yet as <hi>totum homogeneum.</hi> The Author would do well to aÅ¿Å¿ay a clearing and extricating of theÅ¿e things upon his Principles.</p>

                     </gap> is no ViÅ¿ible Church exiÅ¿ting, but a particular Congregation; I would ask whether <hi>Paul</hi> had been a ViÅ¿ible Church-member before this time any other where? And if Å¿o, whether he did now ceaÅ¿e to be a ViÅ¿ible member of that former Church, and Å¿o of all Churches, by Å¿uiting to be a member of the Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> untill he was received in there? Then when he removed again from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> whether he laid down his memberÅ¿hip in that Church? Or if he continued Å¿tanding in it, when he was travelling through the world? Then if he laid it down, whether he behoved to be Å¿tated a member in another ViÅ¿ible Church, and then in another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he removed from one place to another? 2. Whereas the Author Å¿ayes that the DiÅ¿ciples at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> their carriage toward <hi>Paul</hi> was from light, and conÅ¿cience, and tenderneÅ¿Å¿e in the mater of the conÅ¿titution of the ViÅ¿ible Church, and that they did fear they Å¿hould take in a heterogeneal peece, is evidently a bold fiction beÅ¿ide the Text: And he muÅ¿t give me leave to doubt if he Å¿poke that in good Å¿ad-earneÅ¿t, can any man conceive any other thing to be meant by theÅ¿e words <hi>they all feared him,</hi> but this: that when as he had before been a violent perÅ¿ecutor of ChriÅ¿tians, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he was Å¿till Å¿uch an one, and might be now only Å¿eeking to inÅ¿inuate himÅ¿elf amongÅ¿t them as a Wolfe to deÅ¿troy them<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> That they feared him the Å¿ame way that <hi>Ananias</hi> did, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> of this Å¿ame Chap. Will any man, I Å¿ay, that reads the Story, when he comes to this PaÅ¿Å¿age, conceive otherwayes of the meaning thereof? Nay, I appeal to the Authors own conÅ¿cience, if upon Å¿erious looking again upon the words and the Å¿eries of the Story, himÅ¿elf can conceive otherwiÅ¿e of it. Now Å¿uch a fear as this, and that light, conÅ¿cience, and tenderneÅ¿Å¿e in the mater of Church conÅ¿titution are very different things. As for his Argumentative queÅ¿tioning, <hi>What did they fear? That he did not make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿tianity? Why, now he tendered himÅ¿elf to do it,âbut it is evident that they feared he did but meerly profeÅ¿Å¿e, &amp;c.</hi> I <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> 'Tis very poor and unbeÅ¿eeming a man of underÅ¿tanding

And <hi>Barnabas</hi> his bringing him to the ApoÅ¿tles, and his diÅ¿courÅ¿e touching the Lords dealing with him (wherein I confeÅ¿Å¿e there is Å¿o much, as might Å¿way their judgements to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him not only one Å¿eriouÅ¿ly and <hi>Å¿ine dolo malo</hi> ProfeÅ¿Å¿ing ChriÅ¿tianity: but alÅ¿o a truely gracious convert, yea, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t too) was to take this fear out of their hearts, that they might without apprehenÅ¿ion of danger converÅ¿e with him.

He Å¿uppoÅ¿eth that all and every one that were then viÅ¿ibly added to the Church, and none elÅ¿e were added but Å¿uch as were tranÅ¿lated to the Å¿tate of grace, partakers of the Å¿ure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> really in ChriÅ¿t, at leaÅ¿t Å¿o far as they could make judgement between things that differed: But firÅ¿t, I ask where doth he find, or how will he make out of the Text that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Å¿o far as they could make judgement,</hi> &amp;c. and that the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

The Author Å¿uppoÅ¿eth that the ApoÅ¿tle here is Å¿peaking to a <hi>Church of the Jews, i. e.</hi> to one particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, diÅ¿tinct from all the reÅ¿t of the JewiÅ¿h Churches. This is but a bare AÅ¿Å¿ertion without any proof or Å¿emblance of proof join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. We know that Å¿ome of the Learned Interpreters take this EpiÅ¿tle to have been written not to any particular Church or Congregation, but to the whole multitude of the <hi>Jews</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿ing ChriÅ¿tian Religion, Å¿cattered abroad through the world, as were the EpiÅ¿tles of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> and have for them an argument not improbable from that 2.

He Å¿eems to Å¿uppoÅ¿e a clear untruth of theÅ¿e to whom the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaketh, <hi>viz.</hi> that they did apoÅ¿tatize much, forÅ¿ook their AÅ¿Å¿emblies, their mutuall exhorting with all the means of grace and life: Indeed the ApoÅ¿tle warneth them to take heed of theÅ¿e things, and Å¿peaks of Å¿ome that did Å¿o; but as for them he writeth unto, he layeth no Å¿uch thing to their charge as done by them, but giveth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿timony to the contrair, <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 32, 33, 34, 39. 4.

And I prove that it is to be Interpreted thus, and not as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> will have it. The ApoÅ¿tle meaneth the Å¿ame here, <hi>whoÅ¿e houÅ¿e ye are, &amp;c.</hi> which he Å¿aith v. 14. <hi>We are partakers of ChriÅ¿t if we hold faÅ¿t the beginning of our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, &amp;c.</hi> So Interpreters agree that one and the Å¿ame thing is Å¿aid in both verÅ¿es, and the very purpoÅ¿e it Å¿elf evidenceth Å¿o much. But now is <hi>partaking of ChriÅ¿t</hi> nothing elÅ¿e but to be in a ViÅ¿ible Church Å¿tate? Yea for confirmation let it be obÅ¿erved that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle Å¿aith not <hi>whoÅ¿e houÅ¿e ye are,</hi> but <hi>we are,</hi> Å¿o that he Å¿peaks of Å¿ome what under the metaphor of <hi>houÅ¿e</hi> which he Å¿uppoÅ¿eth common to him and them together.

Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> hes not heeded this, or has purpoÅ¿ely paÅ¿Å¿ed it over. 5. There Å¿eemeth to me in Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> words here Å¿omewhat very like the <hi>Arminian</hi> apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tacy of Saints, <hi>while you hold faÅ¿t</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>the practice and power of what you profeÅ¿Å¿e, and when you let it go, &amp;c.</hi> is he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of this judgement, that men may have the practice and power of godlineÅ¿Å¿e, and afterward let it go?

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106774:30"/> here which is capable of viÅ¿ible &amp; limited DiÅ¿ciplin; but the Church InviÅ¿ible is not capable of this: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c. AnÅ¿.</hi> 1.

If I deny the ConÅ¿equence; how will he prove it? I do not Å¿ee it, nor think he Å¿hall ever be able to make it out. 2. But to paÅ¿Å¿e the PropoÅ¿ition, let's Å¿ee the proof of the AÅ¿Å¿umption. <hi>The InviÅ¿ible Church is the greateÅ¿t part in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they which are in earth as one with them, as one entire univerÅ¿all body whereof ChriÅ¿t is the Head, are not capable of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> 1. That part of the univerÅ¿all Church which is in Heaven is impertinently brought on the Å¿tage here: ChriÅ¿t is Å¿peaking of thoÅ¿e that are yet to be built, or are a building; therefore we Å¿ay He is Å¿peaking of Å¿uch as are on earth. 2. Albeit that part of the InviÅ¿ible Church that is on earth be not capable of viÅ¿ible and limited DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, <hi>formally conÅ¿idered as Å¿uch, i. e.</hi> as the InviÅ¿ible Church: nor yet <hi>collectively</hi> conÅ¿idered, as one intire body: yet the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible Church <hi>materially, i. e.</hi> theÅ¿e that are the InviÅ¿ible Church, being alÅ¿o a part of the Church viÅ¿ible, and conÅ¿idered <hi>diÅ¿tributive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in parrs, may be capable of viÅ¿ible DiÅ¿cipline. <hi>David, Peter, John,</hi> and the reÅ¿t who make up the Church InviÅ¿ible, as they are alÅ¿o outward ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours with others, are capable of viÅ¿ible DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. O! then you will Å¿ay, why?

If by the name of the Church here be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood the Church ViÅ¿ible, as Å¿ome later Orthodox Divines have expounded it, namely judicious and learned <hi>HudÅ¿on</hi> in his acurate and elaborate Vindication of the <hi>EÅ¿Å¿ence</hi> and <hi>

Taking the name of the <hi>Church</hi> Å¿o, here the meaning of the whole Å¿entence <hi>upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> is nothing elÅ¿e but this (as the learned Author, but now cited, well obÅ¿erveth) that the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion and Doctrine of this Truth, that the MeÅ¿Å¿iah is already come, &amp; that this JeÅ¿us is the MeÅ¿Å¿iah, &amp; this JeÅ¿us the MeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah is the Son of God, the Doctrine and confeÅ¿Å¿ion that <hi>JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is come in the fleÅ¿h,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2, 3. and the beleeving that <hi>I am he</hi> (Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t) <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24. is the foundation whereon the Church of the New TeÅ¿t. is to be built; out of all which nothing more can follow, as to the qualification of members of the viÅ¿ible Church, of the New TeÅ¿t. then this; that when as the Jews under the Old TeÅ¿t. beleeved in an indefinite MeÅ¿Å¿iah to come: now under the New TeÅ¿t. none can be of the ChriÅ¿tian Church, but Å¿uch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves and confeÅ¿Å¿es that the MeÅ¿Å¿iah is come, &amp;c.

I wiÅ¿h he had named the men and deÅ¿igned the place where they Å¿ay it; Nay were it not we are unwilling this peece Å¿hould grow too big, we could produce of theÅ¿e good men, who have directly and Å¿olidely refuted Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Tenet, as he hath it, in ancient Anab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ptiÅ¿ts. He would have done well alÅ¿o to have pointed us to Å¿ome of theÅ¿e places of Scripture which they could not tell how to give life to, without complyance with his Tenet, and Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e Å¿eeming contradictions in their commentaries, which cannot be agreed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that graine he Å¿peaketh of; untill he do this, we muÅ¿t account what is Å¿poken by him here, but groundleÅ¿Å¿e and empty boaÅ¿ting.</p>
                  <p>2. That in the whole diÅ¿courÅ¿e upon this place Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿peaks Å¿o, as that he cannot be Interpret, but to hold none to be members of the ViÅ¿ible Church, but Å¿uch as are endued with true Å¿aving grace and the power of GodlineÅ¿Å¿e <hi>in veritate rei:</hi> He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once in it mentioneth that qualification, <hi>Å¿o far as men can judge:</hi> Yea, his expreÅ¿Å¿ions are Å¿uch as cannot poÅ¿Å¿iblie admit it, as will appear in following the particulars; To which now we come.</p>

I aske here what he underÅ¿tands by <hi>meer profeÅ¿Å¿ing the things of God?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿uch profeÅ¿Å¿ing, as is oppoÅ¿ite to, and deÅ¿titute of, even mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ordinary Å¿eriouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, which may Å¿ometimes be without an inward Å¿aving worke of grace; yea or outward convincing poÅ¿itive evidences of it: Or as it is oppoÅ¿ite unto an inward Å¿aving work?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106774:32"/> If he meant the former, he Å¿hall not have us to contradict his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ion; we Å¿hall grant him that Å¿uch as have not Å¿o much as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>morally</hi> Å¿erious profeÅ¿Å¿ion, Å¿uch as evidently profeÅ¿Å¿e the things of God hiÅ¿trionically, mockingly, manifeÅ¿tly purpoÅ¿ing to deceive, are neither allowed of ChriÅ¿t, nor to be admitted by men as mater of the ViÅ¿ible Church. If he Å¿ay the other, and Å¿o that none are to be admitted into the ViÅ¿ible Church, but Å¿uch as beÅ¿ide profeÅ¿Å¿ion, have alÅ¿o really true, inward, Å¿aving grace, he putteth the Church upon an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility; and in this will be diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by all the judicious of his way. If it Å¿hall be Å¿aid, it may be he meaneth neither, but Å¿uch a profeÅ¿Å¿ion as is oppoÅ¿ite to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itive convincing evidences of grace to the judgement of diÅ¿cerning men, and Å¿o far as they can judge. I Å¿ay, 1. This is not Å¿aid by himÅ¿elf there, nay, he cannot Å¿ay it and hold to all what he Å¿aith here. Why? becauÅ¿e Å¿ome may be Å¿uch, as far as men can judge, and yet Å¿uch as ChriÅ¿t will caÅ¿t out, yea, and hath caÅ¿ten out: and men may be Å¿uch and yet fit to deÅ¿troy the holy City. 2. PerÅ¿ons may be Å¿uch as are not approved and allowed mater by the Lord <hi>in the ViÅ¿ible Church,</hi> and yet the Church may admit them into the Church, without any perill in order to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> without Å¿inning by admitting them: as for inÅ¿tance, <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> If he Å¿ay he meanes not here the Lords not approving &amp; not allowing perÅ¿ons <hi>Å¿impliciter</hi> and in point of their duty, but in relation to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick proceeding with them, <hi>in foro exteriore;</hi> he Å¿hall not have us diÅ¿Å¿entient from him about this in the generall. But him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf hath never this diÅ¿tinction of the Lords approving or not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, when from it at any time he reaÅ¿oneth to the admitting or not admitting of Å¿uch perÅ¿ons. Yea for ought that can be perceived along this Peece, he Å¿eemeth alwayes to Å¿peak of Gods approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or not-approbation of perÅ¿ons in point of their own dutie &amp; <hi>Å¿im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter.</hi> But now to put the moÅ¿t candid conÅ¿truction and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation upon his concluÅ¿ion, let it be Å¿o, that by mater not approven and not-allowed of the Lord in the ViÅ¿ible Church is meant not-approved and not-allowed (no <hi>Å¿impliciter</hi>) but in relation to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick proceeding, <hi>in foro exteriore:</hi> and by perÅ¿ons meerly profeÅ¿Å¿ing, be meant perÅ¿ons not truely gracious (not of neceÅ¿Å¿ity in truth of exiÅ¿tence, but) at leaÅ¿t Å¿o far as men can diÅ¿cern and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106774:33"/> judge. Come we now to Å¿ee what Å¿hadow of this point is in the Scripture alledged here: I Å¿hall go through the grounds laid down from it in order.</p>

If the Catholick ViÅ¿ible Church, I Å¿hall grant that the Å¿tate and welfare thereof though never Å¿o much infeÅ¿ted Å¿hall not be left and ruined utterly: But I doubt much if Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> will acknowledge Å¿uch a ViÅ¿ible Church: Å¿ure I am, theÅ¿e of his way, are very averÅ¿e from acknowledging it, (though it be a thing moÅ¿t certain and clear in the Word of God) becauÅ¿e indeed the granting of it undermines all the frame of their Independent way: Yea and he himÅ¿elf all along his Peece, treating of the mater of the ViÅ¿ible Church, Å¿peaks of a ViÅ¿ible Church, which is nothing elÅ¿e but a particular Congregation. If he mean any one particular Congregation (which is moÅ¿t Å¿uteable to his way) I Å¿ee not how it can be truely Å¿aid that it Å¿hall not be left and ruined; Å¿ure, we find no promiÅ¿e in the Word for this, and the experience of many particular Churches that have been ruined utterly and never raiÅ¿ed again, proves the contrary. 2.

But 2ly. Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿uppoÅ¿eth two things which he mainly Å¿hould have proven, that the outer-court-ChriÅ¿tians are all that have not the power of GodlineÅ¿Å¿e in their heart, though their profeÅ¿Å¿ion and practice in Religion be objectively right and true, and Å¿ubjectively Å¿erious. 2. That caÅ¿ting them out and not meaÅ¿uring them muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood of DiÅ¿ciplinarie ejection, upon that very account that they have not the power of GodlineÅ¿Å¿e. 3. As to that he addeth himÅ¿elf <hi>Å¿uch kind of ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours will Å¿oon in times of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis true, they may be ready to do Å¿o; but tell me, will not even Å¿ome Å¿uch fine, well guilded ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours, who may Å¿eem as far as men can judge to have the power of GodlineÅ¿Å¿e in their heart, be Å¿uch as will be ready Å¿oon to do the Å¿ame?

BecauÅ¿e that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. cited from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. brought in by him for confirmation of his purpoÅ¿e, he is Å¿peaking of, (of the impertinency whereof to the purpoÅ¿e in hand, I mean, the conÅ¿titution of the ViÅ¿ible Church, we Å¿hall Å¿peak preÅ¿ently) Å¿peaketh of truth and reality of grace in the heart, I may Å¿ay, in the very judgement of God himÅ¿elf under which there is no poÅ¿Å¿ibility of miÅ¿take; But to the grounds he goeth upon from this Text. 2. He taketh for granted, that this whole Chapter is taken up to Å¿hew the Å¿tate of the ViÅ¿ible Church in its conÅ¿titution, as Å¿uch, and that it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits intention in the viÅ¿ion Å¿et down in it, to give unto <hi>John</hi> a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern thereof to be a rule to him and others then, and Å¿ucceeding ages, for regulating the conÅ¿titution of it, and particularly in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106774:36"/> point of Church-members; but why did he not aÅ¿Å¿ay Å¿ome proofe of this: MuÅ¿t we take every thing upon his bare aÅ¿Å¿ertion? 'Tis true, Learned <hi>Brightman</hi> in his commentary conceiveth that this viÅ¿ion containeth a common Type of the holy Church in all ages. But 1. In all the progreÅ¿Å¿e of his commentarie on that Chapter, I find not any evident paÅ¿Å¿age pointing at any particular in the viÅ¿ion, as a patern, type, or rule, concerning the qualification of Å¿uch as are to be admitted in the external fellowÅ¿hip of the ViÅ¿ible Church, as the homogeneall parts of the outward viÅ¿ible body. 2. Though I will not Å¿tay here to examine the intent of all the particulars in that viÅ¿ion, and though I eÅ¿teem much of the judgement of that learned and pious man; yet in the generall, I muÅ¿t Å¿ay, I find no convincing argument, nor much appearance of any argument at all brought by him to prove that the intent of the viÅ¿ion was to give <hi>John</hi> a patern, a certain portraicture or reÅ¿emblance of the Church, whereby we might know which is Å¿he. Yea albeit I confeÅ¿Å¿e Å¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars in the viÅ¿ion are things of the Church (in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation whereof I would not much diÅ¿agree from <hi>Brightman</hi>) yet I think he is miÅ¿taken in taking that for the generall intent and purpoÅ¿e of the viÅ¿ion: and conceives that <hi>John</hi> being now to receive a new Propheticall Revelation concerning theÅ¿e things that were to come to paÅ¿Å¿e in and upon the Church from that time to the end of the World, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>fin.</hi> The intention of the viÅ¿ion of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to deÅ¿cribe and Å¿et forth the Glory and MajeÅ¿ty of God the Father, the firÅ¿t Author of the PropheÅ¿ie, as in the next Chapter is deÅ¿cribed the Son the Mediatour and Å¿ubordinate Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it is ordinary when the Lord is to communicate to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and by them to the Church, Propheticall Revelations of great things to come to paÅ¿Å¿e concerning the Church, to preÅ¿ent by way of preparation Å¿ome glorious repreÅ¿entation of himÅ¿elf, as we may Å¿ee, <hi>EÅ¿ay</hi> 6. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.

And in Å¿ome he bringeth but meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, yea and likely is miÅ¿taken, as, could we Å¿tay, might be very probably Å¿hown; as for example, in his ExpoÅ¿ition of the Å¿ea of GlaÅ¿Å¿e like ChriÅ¿tall before the Throne. 3. But what is the particular in the viÅ¿ion from which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> deduceth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ions? this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was in Heaven he Å¿aw it, <hi>a door was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Heaven and the Throne was Å¿et in Heaven, this,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>was to Å¿hadow that theâworÅ¿hippers Å¿hould be indeed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, &amp;c.</hi> and to make it the Å¿tronger, it is confirmed by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariÅ¿on of what was done with <hi>MoÅ¿es, MoÅ¿es had his patern upon the Mount nigh Heaven, &amp;c. AnÅ¿w.</hi> 1. Here is a thing begged for a ground, that as <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was taken up to the Mount to get a patern of theÅ¿e things, which he was to appoint in the ancient Church, Å¿o <hi>Iohn</hi> is here taken up to get a patern of the ViÅ¿ible Church, and the things to be ordered in it under the New TeÅ¿t. This, I Å¿ay, is groundleÅ¿ly Å¿uppoÅ¿ed: For theÅ¿e things that were to be done by <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> were but now a inÅ¿tituting, and to be firÅ¿t Å¿et up: and therefore it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary that he Å¿hould have a patern of them repreÅ¿ented to him to regulate him; but ere the time of this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ChriÅ¿t had fully inÅ¿tituted all particulars belonging to the Church of the New TeÅ¿tament, and many Churches through the World, were already actually Å¿etled and ordered according to that inÅ¿titution, and beÅ¿ide Å¿undry of the Books of the New TeÅ¿t. writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, wherein the inÅ¿titution and rule was already plainly written down, and this indeed is one reaÅ¿on which inclineth me to think that the Å¿cope and intention of the Spirit in this viÅ¿ion was not to give a patern, and portraicture, or modell of the ViÅ¿ible Church for the time to come. 2. As to that alledged meaning of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> receiving his patern near Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> to Å¿hew of what qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the people, <hi>i. e.</hi> the members of the ancient ViÅ¿ible Church Å¿hould be, (<hi>viz. in foro exteriori,</hi> Å¿o muÅ¿t he underÅ¿tand it, if he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106774:37"/> Å¿peak to the purpoÅ¿e in hand) I will not trouble my Å¿elf to inquire who may be theÅ¿e very learned men that Å¿ay Å¿o. But the thing it Å¿elf is but a conjecture: and I deÅ¿ire Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> concerning this, and the expounding of Heaven here, to remember the axiome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Schoole-men themÅ¿elves, otherwiÅ¿e doting on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, <hi>theologia Å¿ymbolica non eÅ¿t Argumentativa,</hi> except where the Spirit of God himÅ¿elf openeth the Å¿ignification. 3. I deÅ¿ire to know what Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> meaneth by <hi>perÅ¿ons really living very near Heaven,</hi> if truely gracious, then what difference between thoÅ¿e, and theÅ¿e afterward brought in with an adverÅ¿ative oppoÅ¿ing them to the former, and why did he propound his Doctrine with a reÅ¿triction to the time of the GoÅ¿pel? 4. That patern which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es</hi> had Å¿hown to him in the Mount, according to which he was commanded to make, did not concern the conÅ¿titution of the body of the then ViÅ¿ible Church, of what, and how qualified perÅ¿ons it was to be made up. But was a patern of the Tabernacle and the things pertaining to it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 9. 40. <hi>S.</hi> The place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 7. referred as Å¿peaking of the ordinary members of the then ViÅ¿ible Church is not to the purpoÅ¿e, for it Å¿peaks of Å¿uch as were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the PrieÅ¿ts Office. See <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Paraeus in locum.</hi> 5. As impertinently, and much more impertinently is the place of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. cited from <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. brought into this diÅ¿courÅ¿e concerning the ViÅ¿ible Church, and the mater thereof. I appeal to all judicious ChriÅ¿tians in the World, and to Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> himÅ¿elf in Å¿econd Å¿erious thoughts, if that Scripture was intended to be a rule of conÅ¿tituting Congregations: Or if it be not a declaration or revelation of Gods purpoÅ¿e and Decree what he is to do himÅ¿elf by his efficacious grace; and if that Covenant and the promiÅ¿es there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of belongeth not in the fulfilling thereof only to the Lords elect.</p>

                     <hi>The Churches of the Romanes, Corinthians, EpheÅ¿ians, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, ColloÅ¿Å¿ians, TheÅ¿Å¿alonians, of the Jews which are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Peter, Iames, and the Author to the Hebrews, and in the Acts, were all thus conÅ¿titute of truely Godly, Å¿o far as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man can make judgement of one like himÅ¿elf, Ergo. if theÅ¿e be denyed as preÅ¿idents, then I would aske our Brethren of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery by what rule they walk? But if theÅ¿e be conÅ¿idered as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idents, I have only to Å¿hew that theÅ¿e Churches did all thus conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, though I think they did not long keep and maintain this pure conÅ¿titution, for which they bore their judgement, &amp; yet bear. AnÅ¿.</hi> Where did Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> read, that the judgement comed and yet lying upon theÅ¿e Churches, came upon them for their admitting and permitting to be in their viÅ¿ible Å¿ociety Å¿uch as were not true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, Å¿uch as God the Å¿earcher of the hearts of all men can bear witneÅ¿Å¿e of as indeed Å¿ealed for his by his Holy Spirit, as far as men truely converted and very Å¿pirituall can diÅ¿cern and judge? We find indeed laid to Å¿ome of their charge that they Å¿uffered Å¿canda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perÅ¿ons, broatchers of errors, and Å¿educers of others into their errors, (Å¿uch, I mean, maintainers of errors, I trow he and others of his way are not averÅ¿e from receiving and Å¿uffering into their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Churches) and I doubt not but for this among other cauÅ¿es, judgement came upon them: But that ever that which he Å¿aith was laid to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eir charge, or that the judgement of God came upon them for that cauÅ¿e, we cannot believe his aÅ¿Å¿ertion; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it to be inÅ¿tanced by proofe: but to the purpoÅ¿e; he Å¿uppoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that beÅ¿ide theÅ¿e particular Churches inÅ¿tanced, and what is Å¿aid of them in the EpiÅ¿tles written to them, there can be no where in Scripture found any thing holden forth as a rule by which we may walk in the conÅ¿titution of the viÅ¿ible Church as to the mater or members t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106774:38"/> Brethren by what rule they walk) import: But we truÅ¿t ere we have done, to find a rule elÅ¿e-where; yet we Å¿hall not deny nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿e theÅ¿e Churches as preÅ¿idents in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, in whatÅ¿oever can be made clear to have been their practice in this mater, I mean, the notion and conÅ¿ideration under which perÅ¿ons were admitted unto, and reckoned in their externall Church-fellowÅ¿hip. Come we then to conÅ¿ider the antecedent of this Argument, or what is affirmed in his induction of theÅ¿e Churches. FirÅ¿t in the generall, and then his proof thereof particularly. The aÅ¿Å¿ertion of them all in generall is, that all of them were conÅ¿titute of perÅ¿ons truely Godly Å¿o far as Godly men could make judgement. <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> if he would have made the <hi>attributum</hi> of this induction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿werable to his concluÅ¿ion intended, he Å¿hould have Å¿aid they were conÅ¿titute of perÅ¿ons <hi>all and every one of them</hi> truely Godly, <hi>and none elÅ¿e.</hi> But he Å¿peaks only indefinitely, which might be granted: But let us take him to mean Å¿o; this aÅ¿Å¿ertion as it lyeth, may be granted in Å¿ome Å¿enÅ¿e which it may carry, and never a whit advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage redound thereby to his Doctrine; for it may carry this Å¿enÅ¿e, that theÅ¿e Churches were made up, or did conÅ¿iÅ¿t of perÅ¿ons all of them truely mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now in the firÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿e it might be granted (as I Å¿uppoÅ¿e Å¿ome Congregation or Congregations may be Å¿uch <hi>eventually,</hi> that all the members may be truely godly) &amp; yet no advantage come thereby to his Tenet, unleÅ¿Å¿e he could prove that the enumeration which he makes is a perfect enumeration of all the particular Churches in Scripture (which he cannot, becauÅ¿e it is clearly contrary to truth, and therefore his induction is imperfect) Yea and this alÅ¿o, that there is no other PaÅ¿Å¿age of Scripture, that holds forth a rule or warrand of any larger latitude touching ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of members into the fellowÅ¿hip of the ViÅ¿ible Church then what is Å¿aid of theÅ¿e Churches. He muÅ¿t prove then the aÅ¿Å¿ertion in the latter Å¿enÅ¿e, <hi>viz.</hi> that theÅ¿e Churches were conÅ¿titute of perÅ¿ons all truely godly as far, &amp;c. <hi>formally</hi> conÅ¿idered as Å¿uch, and under no other conÅ¿ideration, in their in-taking and being rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned members in their outward viÅ¿ible Å¿ocietie: If he could prove
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106774:38"/> this of any one of them we Å¿hould go over to his Å¿ide of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ie: But now Å¿ee how he proveth this, nay all that is brought or can be brought by him, is only this, that the ApoÅ¿tle Writing to theÅ¿e Churches, calleth them <hi>Å¿aints, beleevers, Å¿anctified in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us,</hi> and the like, which Å¿hould we grant to mean inward true grace of regeneration, and to be Å¿poken not of the whole body <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively</hi> and <hi>confuÅ¿e,</hi> only giving the denomination of the whole from the better part; but <hi>diÅ¿tributively</hi> of all and every one of them; yet nothing elÅ¿e could neceÅ¿Å¿arily be concluded from this, but that they were Å¿uch <hi>de facto</hi> and <hi>quo ad eventum,</hi> and not that they were gathered and received into the externall fellowÅ¿hip of theÅ¿e Churches formally upon this and no other account: that they were Å¿uch reall, internall, truely regenerate Å¿aints. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles in the place cited Å¿peaks not, nor intimates one word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the order of proceeding, or account whereupon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was made in the viÅ¿ible externall conÅ¿tituting and Å¿etting up of theÅ¿e Churches, or admitting of members into them, neither doth Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿o much as once aÅ¿Å¿ay to make a proofe of this point; only after he hes cited Å¿ome paÅ¿Å¿ages concerning the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he Å¿aith, pag.</hi> 22. <hi>end, and pag.</hi> 23. <hi>begin. that theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions Å¿hould import that they did conÅ¿titute &amp; gather together upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, but as there was the true grace of God evident as far as men could judge, I cannot indeed Å¿ee.</hi> Alas! 1. Is this to prove that which being the very main pinch of the QueÅ¿tion, to Å¿ay no more for it, but you cannot Å¿ee how it was not done Å¿o. 2. But I forbear to exaggerat this way of reaÅ¿oning. We are Å¿ure he might Å¿ee in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture how perÅ¿ons were gathered and received into the fellowÅ¿hip of the ViÅ¿ible Church upon another account, and truÅ¿t by the Lords aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance ere we have done to let it be Å¿een by Å¿uch as will not Å¿hut their eyes upon the light of the Word. Thus we have Å¿aid already, doth Å¿ufficiently diÅ¿cover the weakneÅ¿Å¿e and nullity of the inductive Argument to the point in controverÅ¿ie. And I muÅ¿t Å¿ay, I wonder that Learned men (Å¿uch as I do with all reÅ¿pect, acknowledge our Independent Brethren to be) Å¿hould have put Å¿uch confidence in it.</p>

We will not Å¿ay it is a temporary faith he Å¿peaks of, we grant it to be a Å¿aving perÅ¿evering faith, and for confirmation of this he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Å¿tronger ground from the Text then theÅ¿e he hath choÅ¿en, that they are all called <hi>beloved of God,</hi> and <hi>called Saints,</hi> where, as <hi>EÅ¿tius</hi> noteth well, <hi>intelligitur vocatio non communis &amp; exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> is underÅ¿tood, not common and outward calling, but that whereby men are effectually called to faith, holineÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿alvation, which is the calling according to purpoÅ¿e and PredeÅ¿tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But now will Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> or any man take upon them to Å¿ay, that <hi>Paul</hi> mean'd that all and every one in the ViÅ¿ible Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were Å¿uch as had not a temporary faith only, but a true Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, and Å¿o were all and every one Å¿uch as were to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Å¿aved.

We Å¿ay the ApoÅ¿tle in theÅ¿e titles of <hi>beloved of God, Saints, Beleevers,</hi> meaneth true Å¿aving grace, truely exiÅ¿ting, and not in the judgement of charity only: But Å¿peaketh there not of all the Romanes <hi>univerÅ¿aliter &amp; diÅ¿tributivÃ¨,</hi> as we Å¿ay all men are Å¿inners, but <hi>communiter &amp; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectivÃ¨, &amp; confuÅ¿Ã¨, i. e.</hi> in common, collectively, and confuÅ¿ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauÅ¿e undoubtedly Å¿aving grace was amongÅ¿t them, and he could not take upon him to determine, whether moe or fewer of them were endued with it, and as it Å¿eems knew nothing to the contrary of any of them particularly, but they might be Å¿uch. Thus verily I think the ApoÅ¿tles writing to whole Churches, and calling them generally by the name of Saints, faithfull, &amp;c. may well be underÅ¿tood; and no other thing can be demonÅ¿trate of their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Take herewith the judgement of the Learned Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on the place, all of which do unanimouÅ¿ly determine that theÅ¿e titles of Saints, faithfull, and the like, are given by the ApoÅ¿tles to the Churches; partly in reÅ¿pect of the end of their calling, and the duty of every one in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that the end of their

I adde now this, by what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿aith here,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106774:40"/> and indeed by the Doctrine of all the Independent Brethren of his way, in this mater of the conÅ¿titution of the ViÅ¿ible Church, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that their conception about the order of gathering the ViÅ¿ible Church by the ApoÅ¿tles was this, that men being firÅ¿t turned to the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿tian Religion, there was a tryall made of their evidences of true inward Å¿aving grace, and Å¿uch as eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Å¿atisfactory of this were found in, theÅ¿e were gathered in, and the reÅ¿t caÅ¿ten by, which I dare Å¿ay is a meer fiction, of which not the leaÅ¿t veÅ¿tige can be Å¿hown in Scripture, and never man dreamed of untill theÅ¿e Å¿ad times, broodie of many new fancies under the name of new lights. 3. I confeÅ¿Å¿e perÅ¿ons having Å¿uch grace in them as Å¿hall be confirmed to the end, as keeps them waiting for the coming of ChriÅ¿t, as are the comfortable Å¿eals of a faithfull MiniÅ¿try, are not outward ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours only, but are reall Saints and Elect, and thence I conclude, it cannot be underÅ¿tood univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ally of all and every one of the ViÅ¿ible Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Will he Å¿ay that all and every one were reall Saints, Elect, to be confirmed unto the end, and Å¿o eternally Å¿aved; if he Å¿ay, yes, in <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, Å¿o far as he could judge upon evidences of true grace. I Å¿ay, 1. That is an addition to the Text, <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith Å¿imply he Å¿hall confirm you unto the end, &amp;c. not Å¿o far as I can judge he Å¿hall confirm you. Yea, 2. It enervats the comfort held forth by the ApoÅ¿tle to them he Å¿peaks to, for it imports no more upon the mater, but this, poÅ¿Å¿ibly ye may be confirmed to the end, and Å¿o when all is done ye may be poÅ¿Å¿ibly not confirmed to the end: (mans judgement can go no further) and is contrary to the Å¿train of all the Orthodox, writing againÅ¿t the RemonÅ¿traints in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of perÅ¿everance, who underÅ¿tand the place of Saints, and the Lords effectuall gracious preÅ¿erving them <hi>in veritate rei,</hi> and Å¿o make uÅ¿e of the place, and preÅ¿Å¿e it againÅ¿t the RemonÅ¿trants. But let Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> rid himÅ¿elf here; if he will have <hi>Paul</hi> to Å¿peak thus of all and every one of the ViÅ¿ible Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> either he muÅ¿t conceive it Å¿poken only with relation to the Å¿tate of that Church as its firÅ¿t up-Å¿etting: or alÅ¿o in relation to what it was at the preÅ¿ent time of the Writing of this EpiÅ¿tle: The former cannot be Å¿aid, becauÅ¿e its moÅ¿t evident all along that PaÅ¿Å¿age, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. he is Å¿peaking of it as Å¿till, at the time of his writing, Å¿tanding in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106774:41"/> he expreÅ¿Å¿eth in his words, albeit Å¿ome of the Verbs be uÅ¿ed in the preterit perfect tenÅ¿e, no man can deny this who hath any judgement. If he Å¿ay the latter, the very EpiÅ¿tle it Å¿elf will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it, wherein, to wit, Å¿o groÅ¿Å¿e wickedneÅ¿Å¿es, and impieties are diÅ¿covered to have been amongÅ¿t them, and laid to their charge, Å¿chiÅ¿mes, contentious Å¿uits of Law, fornications, communion and fellowÅ¿hip at Idolatrous Tables, drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, deniall of the ReÅ¿urrection. Will any man Å¿ay, that the ApoÅ¿tle knowing Å¿uch things to be amongÅ¿t them, Å¿peaks of all and every one of them as reall inward Saints as far as men can judge.</p>

The Å¿econd argument: <hi>nay upon this ground the Elders Å¿hould not know,</hi> &amp;c. To Å¿ay it, with reverence to the memory of the Author, is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any body of common judgement, exceedingly weak; For, 1. How followeth that, if the Church redeemed by the blood of God, be the Elect only, then the Elders Å¿hould not know what their care was, nor upon whom they Å¿hould beÅ¿tow it, for it muÅ¿t have this for a reaÅ¿on of it, that Church which is Å¿aid to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the only object of the Elders care, which they are required to attend. This we deny, we Å¿ay they are part of it, with <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker.</hi> 2.

It is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary or a PaÅ¿tour to feed the Elect, that he know diÅ¿tinctly who are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106774:44"/> the Å¿ingular perÅ¿ons by the head, but for feeding by publick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it is Å¿ufficient that he know them confuÅ¿edly, that they are there in the Congregation; and if he have any grounds of a poÅ¿itive judgement concerning particular perÅ¿ons, that indeed gives him further advantage to apply himÅ¿elf to thoÅ¿e in a more particularly applicatory way. If indeed it were the MiniÅ¿ters work to feed <hi>efficaciter,</hi> to give the increaÅ¿e (as the ApoÅ¿tle expreÅ¿Å¿eth the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all efficaciouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, or efficiency of grace) and they were required to feed the elect that way, I confeÅ¿Å¿e if the Lord did not diÅ¿tinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point out the particular perÅ¿ons to them; then they might make Å¿uch a reply, Lord I cannot Å¿earch into thy Å¿ecrets to perceive who are theÅ¿e, &amp;c. but the efficiency of grace is in Gods own hand alone, and the MiniÅ¿ter has upon him but an externall, morall, Å¿uaÅ¿ive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration, which he is to diÅ¿penÅ¿e for the good of the elect, but he needeth not for that know them diÅ¿tinctly, it is enough, he knowes they are there, where he diÅ¿penÅ¿eth them, and let God diÅ¿cern and waile them out from the reÅ¿t. 3. It is a groundleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uppoÅ¿ition, and contrary to the truth, that in the current and common Å¿enÅ¿e of Scripture, that <hi>redeemed</hi> being Å¿poken of Å¿pirituall redemption from Å¿in, and eternall wrath, (as for the name <hi>[Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified]</hi> it is not in this text, and therefore is impertinently brought in here) is taken for <hi>redeemed viÅ¿ibly,</hi> though not <hi>really.</hi> I doubt he can bring many paÅ¿Å¿ages of Scripture, wherein it can with any appearance be Å¿o exponed; yea viÅ¿ibly redeemed, is an expreÅ¿Å¿ion in my judgement Å¿trange to Scripture: Let this Å¿uffice us in anÅ¿wer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker</hi> in this particular: We doubt not but Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furd,</hi> will have more full and acurate conÅ¿iderations on it.</p>

The intention and Å¿cope of that place is not to hold forth a rule concerning the ordering of the conÅ¿titution of the Church, but to foretell an event that was to come to paÅ¿Å¿e upon the Church in time of AntichriÅ¿ts prevalencie; that <hi>which is without</hi> Å¿ignifieth not perÅ¿ons, but the face &amp; outward Å¿tate of the ViÅ¿ible Church, and <hi>caÅ¿ting out</hi> is not un-Churching of perÅ¿ons, but judicial giving up the outward Å¿tate of the ViÅ¿ible Church to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿t and his followers, and by <hi>meaÅ¿uring</hi> there is not meant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106774:48"/> of the conÅ¿titution of a Society, but a typicall predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Å¿traitneÅ¿Å¿e that Orthodox and Godly WorÅ¿hippers were to be at that time redacted unto. 5. But what meaneth Mr. <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier,</hi> when being about to infringe the objection brought againÅ¿t his induction of theÅ¿e Churches, (<hi>viz.</hi> that there were wicked perÅ¿ons in them) and Å¿aying that becauÅ¿e bad men were in the Churches it doth not follow, therefore they Å¿hould be in them, he caÅ¿teth in that, <hi>the generall eÅ¿tate of which in Å¿uch a time of the World</hi> John <hi>Å¿peaketh, Rev.</hi> 11. 1, 2. what meaneth he, I Å¿ay, by Å¿uch a time of the World wherein the generall Å¿tate of the Churches were Å¿uch? if he mean that time wherein the EpiÅ¿tles were written to the Churches. 1. That paÅ¿Å¿age of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is impertinently alledged; for, be the meaning of it what it will, it Å¿peaks in relation to another time, long afterward to come. 2. It is certain 'tis the alledgeance in his own induction that theÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tles importe that then they were all conÅ¿titute of true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good ones Å¿o far as men could judge, If he mean another time then that, he Å¿peaks this as impertinently; for the objection Å¿peaks of theÅ¿e Churches in relation to the time when the EpiÅ¿tles were written to them.</p>
                  <p>2ly. Saith he in his anÅ¿wer, <hi>Churches may be negligent, and not Å¿o Å¿trict to their rule to examine and prove the grace of God in Å¿uch as offer to joyn themÅ¿elves, as the Church of JeruÅ¿alem did, if Churches do not mind diligently their rule, they may have evil perÅ¿ons among them enough, and yet not be able to maintain that it Å¿hould be Å¿o; 'tis like the AÅ¿ian Churches, and moÅ¿t of the firÅ¿t, quickly after the ApoÅ¿tles time grew faulty in this kind. AnÅ¿.</hi> 1. Reader, Å¿ee here pretty Logick: Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> in his induction undertook to prove and conclude a rule from the examples of theÅ¿e particular Churches, that becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e particular Churches were conÅ¿titute of perÅ¿ons truely good, therefore all Churches ought to be conÅ¿titute only of Å¿uch perÅ¿ons; it is objected, there were many other perÅ¿ons then Å¿uch, in theÅ¿e Churches; and now he anÅ¿we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Churches</hi> (he muÅ¿t apply it to theÅ¿e Churches, elÅ¿e he is <hi>extra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oleas</hi>) may be negligent and not Å¿o Å¿trict to their rule; is not this a running in a round? TheÅ¿e Churches were conÅ¿titute of Å¿uch members, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Å¿o ought all Churches generally to be, if they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106774:48"/> were conÅ¿titute of any other, it was becauÅ¿e they were not Å¿trict to their rule, <hi>i. e.</hi> in plain Language, becauÅ¿e they were not conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute as Churches ought to be. 2. But let go this, and the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Argument; for it is clearly quite here, and refuge had to the generall rule. I Å¿ay where is that rule of examining and proving the grace of God in Å¿uch as offer themÅ¿elves to joyn, that they were not Å¿o Å¿trict to as they Å¿hould? And where have we an inÅ¿tance of the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alems</hi> greater Å¿trictneÅ¿Å¿e to that rule then theÅ¿e other Churches? Thus to Å¿et down naked aÅ¿Å¿ertions, is it not to deÅ¿piÅ¿e hearers and Readers? 3. To what purpoÅ¿e do ye Å¿peak of the Churches of <hi>AÅ¿ia,</hi> and other firÅ¿t Churches their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice after the ApoÅ¿tles time? The objection Å¿peaks of theÅ¿e Churches even as they were when the ApoÅ¿tles were living and did write to them theÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tles, out of which you labour to inÅ¿truct your induction of them.</p>
                  <p>3ly. <hi>Or Churches</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>though very diligent and duely Å¿trict in this mater, yet are not infallible, and therefore hypocrits may deceive a Church for a time, and Å¿o get in where they have no right to be; the ApoÅ¿tle Jude doth confeÅ¿Å¿e Å¿o much, v.</hi> 4. <hi>not only perÅ¿ons may thus creep into the Church, but alÅ¿o into office, and Å¿till eÅ¿cape the firÅ¿t judgement made upon them by the Churches of which they are. The ApoÅ¿tle doth intimate this to Timothy, lay hands Å¿uddenly on no man, and his charge on this may make a man tremble,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 21, 22. <hi>We are, as appears by this compared with other Scriptures, to uÅ¿e all care as much as in us lyeth, to prevent by the firÅ¿t judgement of the Church, all that are not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from coming to a Å¿tate to which they are not approved by God, but if men by Å¿ubtilty creep in where they Å¿hould not be, they are to be caÅ¿t out by the after judgement of the Church, which is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, when it doth evidently appear that they are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, though not drunkards, and Å¿uch kind of bodily-Å¿inners, which is far leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿imply conÅ¿idered then hypocriÅ¿ie, which after-judgement is an Ordinance to cleanÅ¿e the houÅ¿e of God and keep it pure, And doth Å¿trongly confirme the point I am on, that the mater of the ViÅ¿ible Church Å¿hould be reall Saints. AnÅ¿.</hi> 1. All this is juÅ¿t nothing to the purpoÅ¿e in hand. Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> to prove his generall Doctrine, that a Church ViÅ¿ible ought to be conÅ¿titute,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106774:49"/> in its matter, of Å¿uch as are truely Godly, at leaÅ¿t Å¿o far as men can judge, had undertaken to Å¿hew by induction, that theÅ¿e par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches were conÅ¿titute of perÅ¿ons all Å¿uch. It was object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had in them Å¿ome others. Now here he tells us in anÅ¿wer that Churches not being infallible may be deceived (and conÅ¿equently Å¿o might thir be) in taking in Å¿uch as ought not to be within. Once granting that it was Å¿o in theÅ¿e Churches, hes he not quite again his alledgeance concerning them in his inductive Argument; and taken him to the generall rule, which was the thing he undertook to prove, and but begs the thing in QueÅ¿tion? But to the mater in this branch of the AnÅ¿wer. Then, 2. When he Å¿aith hypocrites have no right to be in the Church, or, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Å¿hould not be there, if the meaning were, that men, though they make a profeÅ¿Å¿ion of Religion, yet continuing hypocrites and graceleÅ¿Å¿e in their hearts do Å¿in in adjoyning themÅ¿elves to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible Church and that they have no right <hi>in foro interiori</hi> this we Å¿hould not deny; but if his meaning be, that no hypocrits have a <hi>jus EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticum</hi> and <hi>in foro exteriori</hi> to be in the ViÅ¿ible Church, we deny it, and he Å¿hall never be able to prove it. 3. 'Tis true that <hi>Jude</hi> Å¿aith, that Å¿uch men creept in unawars into the fellowÅ¿hip of the Church, who afterward kythed to be Å¿uch, as I Å¿hall not deny, they ought to have been caÅ¿ten out: But <hi>Jude</hi> Å¿aith not, that theÅ¿e when they made a ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of Religion, and did not vent Å¿uch abominations, had no <hi>jus EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticum</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Church into their fellowÅ¿hip. 4. All that Mr. <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier</hi> here bringeth in concerning admitting perÅ¿ons into Offices in the Church is idly and impertinently alledged to the point in hand: We acknowledge that none ought to be put in Å¿uch Offices, but Å¿uch as give evidences of all manner of godly converÅ¿ation; We have an expreÅ¿Å¿e and full rule for this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And hands ought not to be laid upon any man, without a foregoing tryall and proofe of theÅ¿e things. But where will ye Å¿hew us in all the Scripture from the one end to the other Å¿uch a rule requiring Å¿uch qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in perÅ¿ons, and Å¿uch a tryall of them before, and in relation to their admiÅ¿Å¿ion into the fellowÅ¿hip of the ViÅ¿ible Church; And to be under PaÅ¿torall care and the MiniÅ¿try of the Word? If he could Å¿hew us this, either in precept or approved practice, we
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106774:49"/> Å¿hould Å¿oon yeeld, and be at an end of this controver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                     </gap>e; But this he cannot, nor ever will be able to Å¿hew; and therefore the reaÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the care and acuracy to be uÅ¿ed in trying perÅ¿ons, who are already in the Church, in relation to admitting them to places of office, unto admiÅ¿Å¿ion of perÅ¿ons into the Å¿ociety of the ViÅ¿ible Church, is unreaÅ¿onable. 5. When he Å¿aith that men are to be caÅ¿t out by Excommunication, when it doth evidently appear, that they are hypocrites, though not drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deÅ¿ire, 1. That it may be obÅ¿erved that an hypocrite may be taken in a double Å¿enÅ¿e. FirÅ¿t, for Å¿uch an one as groÅ¿Å¿ely and knowingly counterfeits a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿tianity, and Å¿o indeed is nothing elÅ¿e but an hiÅ¿trioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Å¿tage-profeÅ¿Å¿or; Secondly, more largly for any that hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿tianity, wherein, may be, he is morally Å¿erious, but hath not within a Principle of true, Å¿upernaturall, Å¿aving grace: Such are all unregenerate perÅ¿ons in the Church, Å¿uch an one was that young Man in the GoÅ¿pel, whom our Lord is Å¿aid to have loved, and the Lawyer of whom he Å¿aid, thou art not far from the Kingdome of Heaven. Now if we Å¿peak of hypocrites in the former Å¿enÅ¿e, if men appear to be Å¿uch, I Å¿hall confeÅ¿Å¿e that if they have been within they are to be caÅ¿t out by Excommunication, yet in the order that ChriÅ¿t hath preÅ¿cribed, after due admonition and evidence of obÅ¿tinacy and incorrigibleneÅ¿Å¿e in the evill, and of this I Å¿hall Å¿ay more then Mr. <hi>Lockier, viz.</hi> that it is far greater, not only then drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e, and other Å¿uch bodily Å¿ins Å¿implie <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re peccati</hi> in the nature of Å¿in; But, if it evidently appear, alÅ¿o <hi>in genere Å¿candali</hi> in the nature of Å¿candall (which is the ground and conÅ¿ideration upon which cenÅ¿ure proceedeth,) becauÅ¿e it is a very mocking of God in the higheÅ¿t degree: But if we Å¿peak of hypocrites in the latter Å¿enÅ¿e; We deny utterly that every man appearing to be Å¿uch is to be Excommunicated and caÅ¿ten out of the Societie of the ViÅ¿ible Church. If a man profeÅ¿Å¿e Å¿eriouÅ¿lie Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Å¿ubmitting himÅ¿elf to Ordinances, though there were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yea though it were revealed by God, that yet he were not Regenerate, -and indued with true Å¿upernaturall Grace, I Å¿ay Å¿uch an one were not to be excommunicate; Let Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> or any for him, Å¿hew a warrand of Scripture for Excommunicating a man for non-regeneration. The Doctrine of all Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106774:50"/> hither till, concerning the object of Excommunication, and that grounded upon the Word of God, is that which is Å¿hortly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed by the Learned and Reverend ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours of <hi>Leyden Synop. pur. theol, Objectum circa quod exercetur haec DiÅ¿ciplina Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iaÅ¿tica Å¿unt illi qui fratres nominantur; cauÅ¿a verÃ² eÅ¿t vita pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va vel Doctrina perverÅ¿a, nec ideo Å¿tatim, ubi quis frater nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in hujuÅ¿modi Å¿candala incidit, a corpore EccleÅ¿iae excludi debet, quemadmodum quibuÅ¿dam AnabaptiÅ¿tis in uÅ¿u eÅ¿t: Sed poÅ¿t privatas demum, &amp; publicas EccleÅ¿iae admonitiones contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas &amp; rejectas, Å¿icuti ChriÅ¿ti verba aperte Å¿ignificant, Mat.</hi> 18.] <hi>diÅ¿p.</hi> 48. <hi>theÅ¿.</hi> 25, 26. And though drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿uch like bodily-Å¿ins be leÅ¿Å¿e then hypocriÅ¿ie in this Å¿enÅ¿e, <hi>i. e.</hi> non-regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Å¿imply, and <hi>in genere peccati</hi> in the nature of Å¿in, yet it is not leÅ¿Å¿e <hi>in genere Å¿candali,</hi> in the kind of Å¿candall and offence unto the Church: Nay this hath not the nature of Å¿candall at all. 6. Yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> according to the genius of his Doctrine ought to Å¿ay not only men, <hi>when it doth evidently appear that they are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits,</hi> but even if it <hi>doth not evidently appear</hi> that they are truly gracious, and we cannot diÅ¿cern in them the power of godlineÅ¿Å¿e, they are to be Excommunicate: For his Doctrine is that none are fit mater to be admitted or permitted to conÅ¿titute a ViÅ¿ible Church, but Å¿uch as are truely Godly Å¿o far as men truely Godly can judge and diÅ¿cern. I beleeve moÅ¿t of the Independent way will diÅ¿claime him in this. 7. Excommunication is an Ordinance to keep the houÅ¿e of God pure and according to what it ought to be, <hi>in point of duety, in foro exteriori,</hi> and in order to Å¿alvation, this we grant, only in this Å¿enÅ¿e, that it is an Ordinance tending towards this as a means, (for this is an end of Excommunication <hi>that the Å¿pirit may be Å¿aved in the day of the Lord JeÅ¿us</hi>) but not in this Å¿enÅ¿e that the Church is obliged thereby to effectuate it <hi>quoad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum,</hi> this belongeth to God alone. Excommunication is an Ordinance to keep the Church pure and according to what it ought to be, <hi>in point of qualification in foro exteriori,</hi> in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ViÅ¿ible Church-Å¿tate, even <hi>quoad eventum;</hi> But now what this qualification <hi>in foro exteriori</hi> in order to Church-Å¿tate is, is the thing in QueÅ¿tion. So Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> in his reaÅ¿oning from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication to his Doctrine, either alledgeth nothing to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106774:50"/> purpoÅ¿e, taking his antecedent in the former Å¿enÅ¿e; or begs the QueÅ¿tion, taking it in the latter. 8. In the concluÅ¿ion as propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here: FirÅ¿t note, If only reall Saints be the proper mater of a ViÅ¿ible Church, and Å¿aving grace the complexion of it; then all Saints Å¿o far as men can judge, are not fit mater; for theÅ¿e are not neceÅ¿Å¿arily reall Saints, Å¿imply. 2. When as he Å¿aith, <hi>not one known to be otherwiÅ¿e,</hi> he Å¿hould have Å¿aid anÅ¿werably to the former words, no not one, not known, Å¿o far as men can judge, to be Å¿uch. 3. <hi>[Can juÅ¿tifiably enter]</hi> may be conceived, either in point of duty incumbent to themÅ¿elves who enter, and Å¿o the meaning is this, men joyning themÅ¿elves to the ViÅ¿ible Church and making profeÅ¿Å¿ion of Religion, without true faith and repentance, are not juÅ¿tifiable in this before God; or it may be conceived to be Å¿poken of the Churches active admiÅ¿Å¿ion of men into externall Church-communion, and the Å¿enÅ¿e is this, it is not juÅ¿tifiable that men not having Å¿aving grace Å¿hould by the Church be admitted to enter into the fellowÅ¿hip of the ViÅ¿ible Church: If in any thing, certainly in propounding Doctrines, Å¿tating controverÅ¿ies, forming concluÅ¿ions, ambiguities Å¿hould be Å¿hun'd. We grant the former Å¿enÅ¿e, but the latter we deny; and it is not yet proven. This much of the inducti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿uppoÅ¿eth in this Argument that the ViÅ¿ible Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> a particular Independent Congregation muÅ¿t be a Å¿tanding faÅ¿t, laÅ¿ting houÅ¿e, <hi>quae non deficiat,</hi> which is not to fail, and that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity is the priviledge and property of it, in this alÅ¿o joyning with PapiÅ¿ts, againÅ¿t whom all ProteÅ¿tant Divines maintain that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to the Church of the elect, or if to the Church ViÅ¿ible, not to any particular, but to the univerÅ¿all. We grant then that any Church ViÅ¿ible is defectible and may indeed fall, and that even upon that ground amongÅ¿t others that there is not an uniformity and homogeneouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e amongÅ¿t all parts of it, Å¿ome are of the Å¿eed of the Woman, really good; Å¿ome be, at the beÅ¿t, Å¿eemingly good, and really bad, and the Å¿eed of the Serpent (and Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> way will not make it to be otherwayes) and we confeÅ¿Å¿e that it is by the finger of God, that any Church is any long Å¿pace kept Å¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: Yet God will keep ViÅ¿ible Churches Å¿tanding, for all the aÅ¿ymmetry and heterogeneouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of members amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves (as to their inward, Å¿pirituall, eternall Å¿tate) Å¿o long as he has a work for gathering and building up his elect amongÅ¿t them, for whoÅ¿e Å¿ake it is that a ViÅ¿ible Church and his Ordinances therein are Å¿et up. You will Å¿ay, but doth not God this by means? <hi>AnÅ¿:</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106774:52"/> yea verily he uÅ¿eth means which he bleÅ¿Å¿eth and maketh effectuall for that end, to the keeping down of the evills that are in many and would be ready to break out to the undoeing of all, as long as he Å¿ees meet; as the Preaching of the Word, exerciÅ¿e of DiÅ¿cipline againÅ¿t Å¿candals; but God never preÅ¿cribed this as a means for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ViÅ¿ible Churches that no perÅ¿ons Å¿hould be admitted or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be in the ViÅ¿ible Church, but Å¿uch as are Å¿ymmetricall and homogeneall in true Å¿aving grace.

AnÅ¿.</hi> 1. I profeÅ¿Å¿e I cannot forbear to Å¿ay that I find Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> abuÅ¿e much Scripture in the little bounds of this Peece, by moÅ¿t impertinent Citations. What is there in this place to the purpoÅ¿e of the conÅ¿titution of the ViÅ¿ible Church as to its matter or Members? the ApoÅ¿tle here <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. is Å¿peaking of Doctrines fundamentall and Å¿uperÅ¿tructed, and that theÅ¿e ought to be Å¿uitable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that, what is this to the mater of the ViÅ¿ible Church? Ay, Yes, <hi>by Analogie</hi> would he Å¿ay firÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tle uÅ¿eth the Å¿ame <hi>medium</hi> and argues as I do, that if ChriÅ¿t be layed as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>&amp;c. AnÅ¿.</hi> And muÅ¿t that hold UniverÅ¿allie? becauÅ¿e one uÅ¿ing a <hi>medium</hi> in one mater reaÅ¿ons truelie and Å¿olidlie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another uÅ¿ing that <hi>medium</hi> in another mater and reaÅ¿oning
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106774:52"/> that Å¿ame way for forme, muÅ¿t alÅ¿o reaÅ¿on truelie and Å¿olidelie? What if this other erre in the application of the <hi>medium,</hi> and if Å¿ome of his premiÅ¿Å¿es and principles, whereof his argument conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, be falÅ¿e upon the matter? Å¿o it is here: The ApoÅ¿tle reaÅ¿oneth well and concludently upon that principle, that the Å¿uperÅ¿tructure Å¿hould be Å¿uitable to the foundation that Teachers Å¿hould take heed what Doctrines they teach in the Church; BecauÅ¿e he aÅ¿Å¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well that ChriÅ¿t or the Doctrine of ChriÅ¿t is the foundation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point of Doctrine in Religion, and all other Doctrines are the Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perÅ¿tructures; But Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> aÅ¿Å¿umeth amiÅ¿Å¿e that the ViÅ¿ible Church as Å¿uch, is the Å¿uperÅ¿tructure built upon ChriÅ¿t as the Foundation. The Scripture Å¿ayeth no where Å¿o, a ViÅ¿ible Church-Å¿tate, or to be received unto, or to be in the ViÅ¿ible Church Å¿tate, is not to be built on ChriÅ¿t as a Foundation, but is to be taken in under, or to be under the means of being built, either firÅ¿t or in a further degree of advancement, on ChriÅ¿t as a Foundation. But further (Å¿ayeth he) <hi>Å¿ee how he applyes this,</hi> ver. 16, 17. <hi>incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Å¿uperÅ¿tructions, if in point of Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> This is Å¿omewhat Å¿poken in the miÅ¿t, but for ought I can conjecture or conceive, the meaning Å¿eemeth to be this; that wrong Doctrines taught in the Church makes perÅ¿ons unholy, and Å¿o unfit mater for the Church to conÅ¿iÅ¿t of; and Å¿o deÅ¿troyes or defiles the Temple of God, which is, as he conceiveth, the ViÅ¿ible Church. And thus he will have the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. to apply that which he had been Å¿peaking in the preceeding verÅ¿es. Now if this be not a forceing of the purpoÅ¿e and meaning of theÅ¿e two verÅ¿es, let any underÅ¿tanding man in the ChriÅ¿tian World judge. The plain, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine intention and purpoÅ¿e of the ApoÅ¿tle in theÅ¿e verÅ¿es is, to warne and dehort the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from defiling and laying waÅ¿te the Church, either by corrupt, idle, or curious Doctrine not Å¿uitable to the foundation ChriÅ¿t; or by SchiÅ¿maticall addicting themÅ¿elves to this or that man who were teachers among them (which was the purpoÅ¿e whereupon he began this diÅ¿courÅ¿e, <hi>v.</hi> 4.) or both; and that upon theÅ¿e three grounds. 1. The conÅ¿ideration of the dignity they were advanced to, that they were the Temple of God, conÅ¿ecrated by the indwelling Spirit to him. 2. That Å¿uch things did defile, and lay them waÅ¿te. 3. That God would
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106774:53"/> Å¿everly puniÅ¿h Å¿uch as any wayes defiled and deÅ¿troyed them that were a Temple conÅ¿ecrated to him. Ay but, 3.

Mr. <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier</hi> then conceiveth that theÅ¿e words are brought in as a reaÅ¿on why he that teacheth wrong or incongruous Doctrines defiles or deÅ¿troyes the Temple of God: To this Å¿enÅ¿e, the ViÅ¿ible Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of Å¿uch as are holy, and hes the Spirit dwelling in them and none elÅ¿e, therefore men by teaching incongruous Doctrine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men in the Church incongruous mater, <hi>i. e.</hi> unholy, deÅ¿troyes the Temple, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ViÅ¿ible Church. A meer forgerie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to clear Å¿hining evidence of the ApoÅ¿tles context, wherein any man that is not blind may Å¿ee that theÅ¿e words <hi>for the Temple of God is holy,</hi> are given as a reaÅ¿on why theÅ¿e that defile the Temple will be Å¿everly puniÅ¿hed of God; the reaÅ¿on of which conÅ¿equence clearly intimate in the words is, becauÅ¿e God will not indure the defiling or violating of that which is holy and conÅ¿ecrate to himÅ¿elf. 2. True indeed, Å¿uch are the Temple of God which are holy and none elÅ¿e? So Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿uppoÅ¿eth, but without reaÅ¿on or proof.

                  <p>In the end of this paragraph he prompts us another Argument equivalent to this firÅ¿t, from this that ChriÅ¿t is called the Head, and the Church the Body: In form it muÅ¿t Å¿tand thus: If ChriÅ¿t be the Head, there muÅ¿t be an homogenealneÅ¿Å¿e in the Church to him,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106774:53"/> he meaneth they muÅ¿t be truely gracious, and endued with true Å¿aving faith; But ChriÅ¿t is the Head, and the ViÅ¿ible Church his Body. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaÅ¿on of the connexion of the firÅ¿t PropoÅ¿ition is, becauÅ¿e elÅ¿e there can be no mutuall derivation from one to another. <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> 1. ProteÅ¿tant Divines will with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent deny your aÅ¿Å¿umption as PopiÅ¿h, and tell you that it is the Church of the Elect that is the Body of ChriÅ¿t the Head. See but <hi>Whittaker de EccleÅ¿. q,</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>pag.</hi> 449. in <hi>fol.</hi> Yet. 2. For more clear and particular anÅ¿wer we are to conÅ¿ider, that ChriÅ¿t may be Å¿aid to be the Head, and the Church his body, either in a <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Å¿enÅ¿e,</hi> as a King is called the Head of the Common-wealth, and the People are called his Body: Or (to Å¿peak Å¿o) in a <hi>phyÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Å¿enÅ¿e</hi> according to the Å¿imilitude of mans body. Now we grant that ChriÅ¿t is a Head to the ViÅ¿ible Church, and the ViÅ¿ible Church hath unto him the relation of a body in the former Å¿enÅ¿e, ChriÅ¿t is a King of the ViÅ¿ible Church, and the ViÅ¿ible Church is his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Body: But hence it followeth not that there muÅ¿t be Å¿uch a homogenealneÅ¿Å¿e in the Church ViÅ¿ible as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> meaneth, that it be endued with true faith and have the Spirit dwelling in their hearts. And as to the reaÅ¿on of the connexion of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition, we anÅ¿wer, Å¿uch a homogenealneÅ¿Å¿e is not requiÅ¿ite for Å¿uch a derivation, as is from a head politicall to its politicall body; this derivation being only morall, by commands, prohibitions and the like morall actings. But ChriÅ¿t is not a Head in the latter Å¿enÅ¿e, (as the head in the naturall body is) to the Church ViÅ¿ible as Å¿uch; nor is the ViÅ¿ible Church a body to him in this Å¿enÅ¿e, but only <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione activÃ¢</hi> and in externall profeÅ¿Å¿ion: Neither is that deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ChriÅ¿t unto the Church, whereby it groweth up in the Lord, unto the Church as a ViÅ¿ible Church, or conÅ¿idered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its viÅ¿ible conÅ¿titution; But unto the Church InviÅ¿ible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, MyÅ¿ticall as Å¿uch.</p>

For Å¿uch as may be gracious and Godly Å¿o far as men can judge, mens judgement being not infallible in this (as himÅ¿elf confeÅ¿Å¿eth) may be deÅ¿titute of the power of Godlines in their hearts, and Å¿o Å¿uch as will not hold out truth firmly in the midÅ¿t of all trials, may be but dead perÅ¿ons, and Å¿o Å¿uch as in whom God doth not live, walk and dwell. 2. As to that firÅ¿t property and character attributed to a ViÅ¿ible Church from, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. by Mr. <hi>Lockier:</hi> FirÅ¿t, I would aske him if in good earneÅ¿t he meaneth that to be a property of a ViÅ¿ible Church rightly conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in its mater, as it Å¿hould be, that it will bear up the truth and things of God firmly and faithfully to the world in the midÅ¿t of all trials? Sure, this is the very thing that PapiÅ¿ts alledge from this place for the unerrabilitie and indefectibilitie of the ViÅ¿ible Church againÅ¿t which all ProteÅ¿tant Divines diÅ¿putes. Yea it is much more, for PapiÅ¿ts attribute this only to the Catholick Church ViÅ¿ible, acknowledging that all particular ViÅ¿ible Churches may erre and make defection, and let the truth and things of God fall down; excepting only the Roman Church, becauÅ¿e they make it to be the Catholick Church virtually: but Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> acknowledges no Church ViÅ¿ible, but an Independent Congregation, and will have this to be the property of any particular ViÅ¿ible Church, and therefore propounds the Å¿ubject of his concluÅ¿ion here thus, <hi>a Church ViÅ¿ible, i. e.</hi> any ViÅ¿ible Church; now let me put him further to it; either there was never a Church ViÅ¿ible rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titute for mater from the beginning, Å¿eeing all the firÅ¿t conÅ¿titute
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106774:54"/> Churches have made defection and let truth fall down, which if he Å¿ay, beÅ¿ides that it is abÅ¿urd in it Å¿elf, I ask why then did he a little before bring us paterns of right conÅ¿titute Churches from theÅ¿e firÅ¿t mentioned in Scripture? Or if they were right conÅ¿titute, how comes it that they made defection and did not bear up and hold out the truth and things of God, but did let them fall? If he anÅ¿wer, that came to paÅ¿Å¿e, becauÅ¿e they kept not a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution for their mater.

If it be Å¿aid, yet it is not the fault of the admitters that they do Å¿o. <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> That's nothing to the purpoÅ¿e, for whether they be faulty or not, Å¿till it Å¿tandeth good, that by that way it cannot be avoyded but impure and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving will be in the ViÅ¿ible Church, Å¿uch as cannot offer a pure offering. 2. It reproacheth the diÅ¿penÅ¿ation and wiÅ¿dome of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Lord God himÅ¿elf, becauÅ¿e he hes not left in his Word a rule and way whereby the Church ViÅ¿ible may be conÅ¿titute Å¿o as that PropheÅ¿ie and his decree revealed therein concerning his Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice among the Gentiles may be fulfilled, for he hes given no rule whereby the Church ViÅ¿ible may be gotten Å¿o conÅ¿titute as that all the mater thereof Å¿hall be perÅ¿ons truely Godly; But there may be and cannot but be, in it many impure and unbeleeving who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not offer a pure offering.

And why may we not Å¿ay, that the Lord will at Å¿ome time, for carrying on a deÅ¿ign decreed by himÅ¿elf in the way of the diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of his efficacious Grace, make his ViÅ¿ible Church, at leaÅ¿t in moÅ¿t part, the Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, better as to the reality and Power of Religion, then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to be by way of Rule, relating to EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with PerÅ¿ons in admiting them to externall ViÅ¿ible Church-communion.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>11</label> Or, Secondly, It may be formed thus; If the Jews Å¿hall be provoked to turn unto the Lord, and imbrace ChriÅ¿tian Religion, by the glory and purity of his WorÅ¿hip and WorÅ¿hippers, then the ViÅ¿ible Church or Churches (uÅ¿e which ye will now) Å¿hall be conÅ¿titute or conÅ¿iÅ¿t of Å¿uch as are truely Godly: But the former is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the latter alÅ¿o. And I anÅ¿wer: 1. SuppoÅ¿e the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equent be granted in as large an univerÅ¿ality as it can be taken in: Yet it Å¿peaks nothing to the QueÅ¿tion in hand. Why? BecauÅ¿e only of what is to be <hi>de facto &amp; quoad eventum,</hi> by diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of effectuall Grace in the ViÅ¿ible Church; And not what ought to be; by rule, of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, that the Church ViÅ¿ible may be rightly conÅ¿titute in its ViÅ¿ible Church-Å¿tate; and the QueÅ¿tion is about this latter, not that former; And diÅ¿penÅ¿ations of effectuall Grace are not our rule in this. 2. Nor yet doth it follow of neceÅ¿Å¿ity,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106774:57"/> that even <hi>de facto</hi> the Church ViÅ¿ible Å¿hall be Å¿o conÅ¿titute, as to its matter in every difference of time, but only that it Å¿hall be at that time that the Jews are to be brought in and converted to the ChriÅ¿tian Faith. Yea, nor doeth it follow that <hi>de facto</hi> even at that time the Church ViÅ¿ible Å¿hall be Å¿o conÅ¿titute in its mater, that all and every Member thereof Å¿hall be truely Godly and Å¿hining in the manifeÅ¿tations of Purity and the Power of GodlineÅ¿Å¿e; but that Å¿o it Å¿hall be for the moÅ¿t part, and commonly in the ViÅ¿ible Church. I acknowledge that a means of awaking up the Jews to come unto, and imbrace the ChriÅ¿tian Religion, will be a more glorious &amp; full Reformation of ChriÅ¿tians, both in point of WorÅ¿hip and in point of converÅ¿ation: Now SuperÅ¿tition and AntichriÅ¿tian Idolatry amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that are called ChriÅ¿tians (which are theÅ¿e they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ee for the moÅ¿t part) is a Å¿tumbling block to them that ly in their way at this day, and I will not Å¿ay, but the impurity and unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of ChriÅ¿tians is alÅ¿o a Å¿tumbling block to them; Albeit I think they do not Å¿o much Å¿tumble at this as at the former, conÅ¿idering that, which is well known in the places where they live, how much notour and known unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is amongÅ¿t them generally, being for the moÅ¿t part moÅ¿t covetous, exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant uÅ¿urers, cheaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> moÅ¿t evidently, the deadeÅ¿t, formall, Å¿light in performance of their way of WorÅ¿hip (as mine eyes have been witneÅ¿Å¿es) of any people in the World. Yet I Å¿ay, I will not deny that this may Å¿tumble them, and they, may be, do pretend it alÅ¿o; Therefore <hi>Babylon</hi> the Mother of fornications muÅ¿t, and will down; And the Princes of the earth that have given up their power to that Whoore, will hate her &amp; burn her fleÅ¿h with fire; and the Lord will purge and reforme his WorÅ¿hip, and Ordinances, and the ChriÅ¿tian World from SuperÅ¿tition and Idolatry: And I believe alÅ¿o that their is a time coming when there Å¿hall be alÅ¿o a more general and Å¿hining Reformation of the lives of ChriÅ¿tians; &amp; that both theÅ¿e Å¿hall concur as means to provock the Jews to fall in love with the ChriÅ¿tian Religion, and to Å¿eek unto JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t; But that all and every ProfeÅ¿Å¿our in the ViÅ¿ible Church Å¿hall be truely Godly, or Å¿hining Å¿o gloriouÅ¿ly in the Power of GodlineÅ¿Å¿e (for indeed it is not GodlineÅ¿Å¿e Å¿imply Å¿o much, as a more then

Now it can be no new &amp; unuÅ¿uall thing to take of Jews to be Å¿uch: for it had been alwayes Å¿o; therefore we do conceive, with theÅ¿e Learned Interpretets we named and others, by theÅ¿e Brethren, muÅ¿t be meant Gentiles who are called the Jews Brethren becauÅ¿e when now brought in by the GoÅ¿pel, in regard of faith, they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and Gods Children, yea and are called Gods Children, even while yet not actually called, <hi>viz.</hi> in the decree and purpoÅ¿e of God, <hi>John</hi> 11. 52.

                     <hi>Nay, it is but Churches out of a Church: GoÅ¿pel Churches out of a legall Nationall Church, and the one being aboliÅ¿hed, there may be, yea, there ought to be a departing from it and a gathering out of it unto the order which God hath inÅ¿tituted, Å¿o we finde Churches gathered out of that Church of the Jews,</hi> Gal. 1. 22. <hi>And whether he meaneth by being in ChriÅ¿t meerly according to profeÅ¿Å¿ion, Å¿ee</hi> 1 TheÅ¿. 2. 14. <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> 1.

You gather Churches, Å¿ay you, out of a Church, not out of Churches. This is Å¿trange, are not the Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> Churches.

For AnÅ¿wer. We may conÅ¿ider a Nationall or Provinciall Church of a threefold Å¿ort and notion. 1. Wherein all of the Nation are bound to a publick and Å¿olemn typicall Å¿ervice and WorÅ¿hip to be performed in one place choÅ¿en by God, under the inÅ¿pection of one ViÅ¿ible PaÅ¿tor or PrieÅ¿t who in WorÅ¿hip and Sacrifices doth hold forth and repreÅ¿ent the whole People of the Nation. 2. Such a Nationall and Provinciall Church, in which many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches are united and Å¿ubjected unto one Church (as they call it, Mother or Cathedrall Church) and depend upon a ViÅ¿ible PaÅ¿tor; who is PaÅ¿tor and Ruler of all other PaÅ¿tors and particular Churches in the Nation or Province; And wherein the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106774:63"/> Inferiour Churches enjoy Divine Ordinances and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall power and juriÅ¿diction, of that Mother and Cathedrall Church or that Provinciall or Nationall PaÅ¿tor. 3. Such a Nationall Church wherein many particular Churches are joyned and united together under one ViÅ¿ible Church-Government) wherein all are equally and collaterally concerned; and have equall intereÅ¿t for the uÅ¿e and exerciÅ¿e of all theÅ¿e Ordinances, which are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the ViÅ¿ible MiniÅ¿teriall Government of theÅ¿e Churches, and mutuall EccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall fellowÅ¿hip in it, and edification and preÅ¿ervation by it. Now a Nationall Church in the Å¿econd notion is not, nor ever was an Ordinance of God, but a meer invention of men and AntichriÅ¿tian tyrannie, overthrowing the power granted by GOD to the Churches, and PaÅ¿tors. A nationall Church of the firÅ¿t notion and Å¿enÅ¿e was indeed an Ordinance of God. Such were the Jews, but inÅ¿tituted and to continue for a definite time, <hi>viz.</hi> untill the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of time Å¿hould come, and then it was aboliÅ¿hed and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed: And a Church Nationall in this Å¿enÅ¿e was legall. But a Nationall Church in the third Å¿enÅ¿e is not a legall or typicall Church and Ordinance: But <hi>moralis &amp; perpetui juris.</hi> Such was the JewiÅ¿h under the Old TeÅ¿tament in point of Government and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick DiÅ¿cipline. They were many particular Churches, and Synagogues, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All which were joyned and united under one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ViÅ¿ible EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick Government. This ViÅ¿ible Church-Å¿hip (Å¿o to Å¿peak) of the Church of the Jews, as it was not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall (I mean ceremonially) nor typicall; Å¿o neither was it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aboliÅ¿hed. Let Mr. <hi>Lookier</hi> Å¿hew me a Text in the whole New TeÅ¿tament importing an abrogation of it; Nay, we truÅ¿t through the Lords grace, ere we come to an end, to give evidence from the Word of God that there is a Church ViÅ¿ible under the New TeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a larger extent and bounds (I mean in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) then a Province or Nation, even a ViÅ¿ible Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿all. Therefore I conclude that we maintaining a Nationall Church in no other Å¿enÅ¿e then this, which is Å¿till warranted and allowed in the New TeÅ¿tament, it is nothing elÅ¿e but groÅ¿Å¿e SeparatiÅ¿me to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106774:64"/> gather Churches out of Churches upon this account, becauÅ¿e they are united into one Nationall Church in this Å¿enÅ¿e. As to that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> of gathering Churches out of that one Church of the Jews which he would confirm by <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 22. I <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> The alledgeance is groÅ¿Å¿ely impertinent; for why? We are now upon the practice of gathering and conÅ¿tituting Churches in a new ViÅ¿ible Church-Å¿tate, of perÅ¿ons withdrawn from Churches wherein is the Å¿ound Doctrine of the faith of ChriÅ¿t and pure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments according to their inÅ¿titution (Å¿uch as the moÅ¿t judicious and Godly amongÅ¿t the Independent Brethren themÅ¿elves confeÅ¿Å¿e to be true Churches) upon this account, becauÅ¿e they are united into one Nationall Church in point of Government. But now will Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿ay, that the ChriÅ¿tian Churches of the Jews were gathered out of the Jews, upon this account, becauÅ¿e they were a Nationall Church in this Å¿enÅ¿e? He cannot upon any warrand in the world. The ground of their gathering out from the reÅ¿t of the Jews, was becauÅ¿e the reÅ¿t would not beleeve JeÅ¿us to be the MeÅ¿Å¿iah, nor imbrace him as their Saviour: But would Å¿till adhere to their ceremoniall WorÅ¿hip, Sacrifices and PrieÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and would be Å¿aved by their own righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, blaÅ¿phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ChriÅ¿t and his Doctrine.</p>

I think no underÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding adverÅ¿ary, would have moved this as an objection againÅ¿t his Doctrine, handled in this Lecture concerning the matter of the ViÅ¿ible Church. But I think indeed, being well managed, it may be made uÅ¿e of to good purpoÅ¿e againÅ¿t their Independent Churches in point of their Government, thus, The Government that is apt to open a door to Errors, Å¿eemeth, cannot be of God. But Å¿uch is the Independent way of Church Government; Which makes every particular Congregation Independent, and Å¿upreme in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Å¿o that if any of them fall into Error, there is no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick Power on earth, that authoritatively can interpoÅ¿e to

Much miÅ¿taking hes been diÅ¿covered already in this Lecture of Mr. <hi>Lockiers,</hi> but in no one paÅ¿Å¿age hath he worÅ¿e acquyted himÅ¿elf then in this we have now in hand. 1. True, it is no good Argument or prejudice either, againÅ¿t a Tenet or point of Doctrine that many take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion thence to Å¿coffe and break forth into much wickedeeÅ¿Å¿e: But
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106774:66"/> this is not to the purpoÅ¿e in hand. Our alledgeance is that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent way of Church-Government is Å¿uch in the nature of it as giveth occaÅ¿ion to men to run freely without controlement into errours, and is a kinde of Å¿helter, for Å¿uch as holds and maintains er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, to run to, as experience proveth; and this, Å¿ure, if it be not an intrinÅ¿ick Argument yet it is a Å¿trong preÅ¿umption againÅ¿t a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, that it is not of God, the like cannot be Å¿aid of the PreÅ¿byte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian way. 2. As to the two inÅ¿tances brought in. They are as impertinent as the former generall; For neither by the Doctrine of the Trinity was <hi>occaÅ¿ion given</hi> any wayes to the <hi>Arian</hi> hereÅ¿ie. But the Devill raiÅ¿ed up <hi>Arius</hi> and his hereÅ¿ie, <hi>to oppoÅ¿e and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> that fundamentall point of ChriÅ¿tianity. Nor was there, by the Doctrine of JuÅ¿tification cleared by theÅ¿e modern fathers, <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion given</hi> to the Å¿tirres of AnabaptiÅ¿ts: But theÅ¿e were raiÅ¿ed by the Devill <hi>in oppoÅ¿ition againÅ¿t</hi> that and other points of Religion then cleared. I humbly conceive it agrees not well with HiÅ¿torie to Å¿ay that upon <hi>the fathers beginning again</hi> to lay that principall fundamentall of the Trinity; the Devill did Å¿et on foot the <hi>Arian</hi> hereÅ¿ie: The HiÅ¿tory of theÅ¿e times Å¿eemeth to Å¿ay that the Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on foot the <hi>Arian</hi> hereÅ¿ie gave occaÅ¿ion to theÅ¿e ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h and confirm from the Word of God that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and fundamentall of the Trinity. 3. While as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> (by way of application of theÅ¿e things noted on before) firÅ¿t Å¿ayeth, <hi>now in this period of time God hath made another acceÅ¿Å¿ion of light, reÅ¿pecting the roofe and upper part of the houÅ¿e</hi> (meaning his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent way of Church conÅ¿titution and Government) and then Å¿ubjoyneth by way of QueÅ¿tion, <hi>and now what Å¿turres, &amp;c?</hi> Why, what now? <hi>Is all thereforeâ</hi>he but miÅ¿erably begs his QueÅ¿tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that his way is a new acceÅ¿Å¿ion of light. 4. WorÅ¿t of all doth he plead for his own cauÅ¿e in relation to the former Objection when as he alledgeth <hi>that it may rather be thought a way that hath Å¿omething of God in it, which the Devill oppoÅ¿eth, then to conclude to the contrary becauÅ¿e the Devill doth not uÅ¿ually Å¿et againÅ¿t his own;</hi> Why? The Independent way is that which this day all the emiÅ¿Å¿aries of Satan (I mean not meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> To this impertinent diÅ¿courÅ¿e in the generall, if I Å¿hall Å¿ay, that it is nothing elÅ¿e, but an iÅ¿Å¿ue of carnall bitterneÅ¿Å¿e, I think no ingenuous indifferent man, will blame me or think I Å¿ay too much. For, 1. True, Å¿uppoÅ¿e PreÅ¿byterians began firÅ¿t to draw the Å¿word, (which is falÅ¿e, they were forced to it by others drawing it) but was it not for their juÅ¿t defence in vindication and maintainance of the Truth of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and of their juÅ¿t liberty againÅ¿t oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, Prelaticall violence, and arbitrary Government? And muÅ¿t this be charged upon them, as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> doth here,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106774:67"/> as a crime? Tell me Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> what condition were you in and would been in to this day, in all humane appearance, had not Presbyterians begun to draw the Å¿word in that quarrell? Tell me what was the means under God that procured liberty for the Å¿it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of a free Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> 1640? Belike you think it was a crime, that you got not leave to crouch under the burden, and Religion, and Liberties were not Å¿uffered, for Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, to ly Å¿till under oppreÅ¿Å¿ion and uÅ¿urpation. I believe the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t and moÅ¿t ingenuous, and thoÅ¿e that are moÅ¿t eminent amongÅ¿t them, that now are in power amongÅ¿t you and in theÅ¿e Lands, will not approve you in their judgement, for this challenge againÅ¿t us; And unleÅ¿Å¿e I be miÅ¿informed when they were come to this hight of prevalency, they are now in, and we brought to this low condition we are now continuing in, looking back, gave teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their acknowledgement, that our beginning to draw the Å¿word, did put the Å¿word in their hand, tho it was never our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e to put it in their hand, for the effect, for which at laÅ¿t they have made uÅ¿e of it. 2. Your attributing the hightning of the Å¿word to that, to which in likelyhood it would not have come, to the bitterneÅ¿Å¿e and baÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e of Presbyterians, Å¿eeing ye give no proof nor the leaÅ¿t evidence of it (and indeed ye could not) we muÅ¿t crave leave to Å¿ay, it is an injury. Tell me, Sir was it bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿pirit, or did it tend to the hightning of the Å¿word, that the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> having but girded their Å¿word to them, <hi>Anno</hi> 1639. upon promiÅ¿es of tollerable Å¿atisfaction, laid it aÅ¿ide again preÅ¿ently, ere ever they drew it, and having again in the Year 40. being forced to it, by deadly preparations, drawn it, with advantage which they might have proÅ¿ecuted, yet as Å¿oon as they were Å¿ecured by the treaty at <hi>

Indeed theÅ¿e two latter Summer-wars have been the Å¿harpeÅ¿t, and we cannot but Å¿ay, that we have felt; And it becometh us well to juÅ¿tifie the Lord our God in all that he hath brought upon us, and to bear his indignation, becauÅ¿e we have Å¿inned againÅ¿t him, we and our Kings and our Princes and Rulers and the whole People of the Land: But if, as to the quarrell be-between us and man, frowardneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿pirit in us raiÅ¿ed theÅ¿e Å¿torms, tho we can juÅ¿tifie our Å¿elves before the world; Yet we Å¿hall not take upon our Å¿elves to be judges of it: But Å¿hall refer it to the Judgement of him, who is the Judge of the World; and though it Å¿hould be his bleÅ¿Å¿ed good pleaÅ¿ure never to plead our cauÅ¿e by a Å¿enÅ¿ible diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of providence in this world, yet we will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieÅ¿ce in the approbation of his revealed will, without quiting of our innocency, be content to ly down in the grave, and wait for his Å¿entence in the mater when he Å¿hall come to Judge the quick and the dead. And as for you Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> I verily think he Å¿hall never let you go off this world without a challenge from himÅ¿elf, for Å¿uch unchriÅ¿tian, uncharitable inÅ¿ulting over them whom the Lord hath Å¿mitten, and talking to the grief of theÅ¿e whom he hath wounded. 4.

This rule muÅ¿t be Å¿uch as holdeth forth not only the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular characters, upon the having or wanting of which the Church muÅ¿t cognoÅ¿ce, and accordingly as is found to judge men Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or not: But alÅ¿o the very <hi>minimum quod Å¿ic,</hi> the loweÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and meaÅ¿ure whereupon the judgement of the Church is to proceed. My meaning, to Å¿peak as plainly as I can to the weaker Å¿ort is this: the rule muÅ¿t declare, how much is Å¿ufficient and neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary at leaÅ¿t, to ground a poÅ¿itive judgement that a man is Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, of which if a man come Å¿hort, or have any wayes leÅ¿Å¿e, he is to be reputed non-Regenerate, at leaÅ¿t not to be reputed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, which according to Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Doctrine debars him from being received as a Member of the Church.

Here is <hi>altum Å¿ilentium,</hi> and Å¿o again the mater left in the miÅ¿t. To preÅ¿Å¿e this the more and the more clearly, I put the caÅ¿e the perÅ¿on deÅ¿iring to be admitted to the fellowÅ¿hip of the Church, and Å¿o to be judged of the Church, whether Regenerat or not, is one who has been an heathen, living before and till that very time in Å¿ome known Å¿ins (as many Å¿ins are to heathen known Å¿ins) of omiÅ¿Å¿ion and commiÅ¿Å¿ion.

Let a poÅ¿itive AnÅ¿wer be given to this. If any Å¿hall Å¿ay, a definite time is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary for trying Å¿uch an one, if he have Repentance for theÅ¿e Å¿ins, and

What warrant for this in the Word? The places pointed at by that laÅ¿t Author, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. does not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand any Å¿uch thing. In the former two <hi>John BaptiÅ¿t</hi> indeed char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged theÅ¿e people to perform really the work of Reformation and Repentance, that they might not delude themÅ¿elves with vain i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations of intereÅ¿t in God upon common priviledges: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not of them a declaration of the experimentall work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon their hearts, that thereupon a poÅ¿itive judgement might be paÅ¿Å¿ed concerning the truth of the work in their heart. So in the place, <hi>Acts</hi> 8 37. <hi>Philip</hi> tells the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> what is his duety in relation to the Å¿uÅ¿ception of BaptiÅ¿m, that he beleeve with all his heart. And together, I confeÅ¿Å¿e, inÅ¿inuateth the requiring of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿o much, that he might AdminiÅ¿trat baptiÅ¿me to him. But neither does <hi>Philip</hi> require, nor the <hi>Eunuch</hi> make a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the experimentall work in his heart, in relation to paÅ¿Å¿ing a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106774:82"/> poÅ¿itive judgement concerning the inexiÅ¿tence of the work in his heart. Verily, were this made an univerÅ¿all rule or ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judge of profeÅ¿Å¿ours ConverÅ¿ion, and conÅ¿equently of their admiÅ¿Å¿ion unto Church fellowÅ¿hip; many an honeÅ¿t, gracious Å¿oul Å¿hould never obtain Å¿uch a judgement upon them while they live; there being many Å¿uch, who, put them to declarations of this kind, could Å¿ay little or nothing. He that were beÅ¿t read in practicall tractats of the nature of Repentance and Faith, and the way of the Spirits working of theÅ¿e, and had a gift of utterance, Å¿hould carry the faireÅ¿t Å¿entence, what ever were the reall work in his heart; if he could but carry fair outwardly in his converÅ¿ation, as an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may, without Å¿candall.

I deny not but good uÅ¿e may be made of drawing out of ChriÅ¿tians, what experience they find of the work of the Å¿pirit upon their hearts, and conferences between MiniÅ¿ters and People, and between ChriÅ¿tians among themÅ¿elves, may and ought prudently to be exerciÅ¿ed for that end; But I Å¿peak againÅ¿t the making of declarations of this Å¿ort, a generall rule and ground for judiciall tryall and paÅ¿Å¿ing judgement concerning the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ConverÅ¿ion of ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours.</p>

That Regeneration and ConverÅ¿ion being an inward work in the heart, no judgement can be made thereupon by man, but by outward actings. 2. That it is not the outward actings according to their mater, <hi>or the deed done,</hi> but as they are done from Å¿uch principles, faith, and love, and for Å¿uch an end, the glorifying and pleaÅ¿ing of God, that argues the heart to be Regenerat, and the doer to be in ChriÅ¿t and in the Å¿tate of grace, and conÅ¿equently, that a man cannot poÅ¿itively judge of anothers Regeneration by them, but as they appear, Å¿omeway, to be done out of Å¿uch Principles, and for Å¿uch an end. 3. That actings good upon the mater, may in Å¿ome probabilitie, at leaÅ¿t, appear to others, to be done from Å¿uch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and to Å¿uch an end, 'tis not enough to have the mans own word and aÅ¿Å¿ertion for it: but there muÅ¿t be, a good time of them,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106774:83"/> and that under Å¿ome varietie of caÅ¿es and conditions, and Å¿ome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. For to act right for a Å¿tart, or to act right even for a good time, a man coming under no alteration of condition or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Å¿mall or no tentations, does not give much appearance to men without, that theÅ¿e actings are right in their principles and ends. 'Tis evenneÅ¿Å¿e and conÅ¿tancy in alterations of caÅ¿es, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tentations aÅ¿Å¿aulting to turn off the way, that carrieth appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of diÅ¿covery of this. 4. That the greateÅ¿t part even of true Converts are not eminent Saints, but weaklings and but as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that unregenerat civilians and hypocrites may in outwards go far beyond many Å¿ound gracious ChriÅ¿tians. 5. Yea that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true Converts may be under the prevalency of Å¿ome Å¿infull infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and affections, Å¿o far, as not only to have, but for a long time, may be even to their laÅ¿t dayes, as to live (though not with inward liking and allowing (which is not Å¿een by others) yet to the outward committing) in known Å¿infull actings. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, may not gracious ChriÅ¿tians be thus Å¿ubject to an outward courÅ¿e of known cankerdneÅ¿Å¿e or Å¿ome other the like diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper?

I cannot yet agree with him in this, that men are not to be received into the ViÅ¿ible Church but under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of true believers, and poÅ¿itively judged to be Å¿uch, though but probably. 1. I can Å¿ee no warrand in the Word for this. 2. The grounds that the learned Author hints at for it, <hi>pag.</hi> 73. do not Å¿eem convincing. 1. Whereas he Å¿aith that it is all one to be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible member of the Church and a member of the ViÅ¿ible Church. And he that denyeth this will but Å¿hew his vanity. I Å¿ay if the name <hi>Church</hi> be taken in one and the Å¿ame notion in both PropoÅ¿itions, I confeÅ¿Å¿e 'tis true he Å¿aith: and he would Å¿how his vanitie that would deny it: But if in the former thereof <hi>Church</hi> be taken for that Å¿ociety which is ChriÅ¿ts myÅ¿ticall redeemed body, the Epithete <hi>ViÅ¿ible</hi> noting Å¿o, not the nature of memberÅ¿hip, but an adjunct of it: I deny the identity of theÅ¿e two PropoÅ¿itions: and cannot Å¿ee but it is Å¿olide enough to deny it. Again when he Å¿aith that the

I conceive between Å¿uch as are in a courÅ¿e and cariage, which indeed diÅ¿covers evidently and certainly non-regeneration (<hi>e. g.</hi> as to be without the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿tianity, to live in Å¿ome hereÅ¿ie directly contrary to the foundation, as is SocinianiÅ¿m, to live in a conÅ¿tant courÅ¿e of known prophanity) and Å¿uch as are Å¿eemingly Regenerat and Å¿o to be <hi>poÅ¿itively</hi> judged Å¿uch in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; there may be, yea and are many of a midde Å¿ort who are in Å¿uch an eÅ¿tate and condition outward, and as relating to mans judgement of them that as they do not, unto full certainty of judgement, diÅ¿cover themÅ¿elves non-regenerat, Å¿o there is not Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground poÅ¿itively to judge them probably Regenerat, and Å¿o to uÅ¿e them, that is to diÅ¿pence Ordinances to them as Å¿uch and in a way Å¿uteable to men Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be Regenerat: But the moÅ¿t we can in our judgement of their Å¿tate is to preÅ¿cind from paÅ¿Å¿ing a poÅ¿itive judgement either way; as for example, a man when he comes firÅ¿t to make a Å¿erious, Å¿ober profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the faith, before we have further experience of his way, or of whom we know no more as yet, but that he Å¿eriouÅ¿ly profeÅ¿Å¿eth the truth, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Å¿ubjection to Ordinances, I confeÅ¿Å¿e this is a ground Å¿ufficient, probably to judge the man is elect, God has a purpoÅ¿e to Å¿ave him, and could we not judge this much probable of him, I will not Å¿ay we Å¿hould receive him in that caÅ¿e. But it is not Å¿ufficient this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and by it Å¿elf, to ground a poÅ¿itive judgement that he is Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat or actually in the Å¿tate of grace, though you call it a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of probability; my reaÅ¿on is this, becauÅ¿e to ground a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itive act of judgement, that a man is Regenerat <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> there is requiÅ¿ite Å¿ome Å¿eemingneÅ¿Å¿e (to Å¿peak Å¿o) of Å¿pirituall Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in a mans profeÅ¿Å¿ion, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he doth it from a Å¿pirituall principle, upon Å¿pirituall motives, and for a Å¿pirituall end: But a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106774:85"/> meer Å¿ober, not mocking, Å¿erious profeÅ¿Å¿ion without more is not a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itive appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of Å¿pirituall Å¿upernaturall Å¿incerity; at leaÅ¿t, therefore I humbly conceive it is a miÅ¿take to confound Å¿eriouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, if he underÅ¿tand Å¿piritual or Å¿upernatural Å¿incerity (as he muÅ¿t underÅ¿tand it here) for that is larger then this: many are Å¿erious in their profeÅ¿Å¿ion, who are not Å¿incere in this Å¿enÅ¿e: yea may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Å¿eriouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e when they do not as yet give any poÅ¿itive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this.

I humbly conceive, there cannot be had poÅ¿itive, probable evidences of this, ordinarly, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation of a mans way after profeÅ¿Å¿ion for a time, wherein notice may be taken of his walking equally in the latitude of duties, and conÅ¿tantly in variety of caÅ¿es and conditions. But the other may Å¿ooner and more eaÅ¿ily appear and poÅ¿itively be judged of, as we judge of a mans Å¿eriouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in any other action. And 'tis Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own judgement, that as Å¿oon as a man maketh profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the faith, without delay or tryall for diÅ¿covery of his heart-ConverÅ¿ion, he is to be admitted into the ViÅ¿ible Church. To conclude, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and I are at agreement upon the mater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the qualification that is Å¿ufficient for admitting perÅ¿ons into the ViÅ¿ible Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Å¿ober Å¿erious profeÅ¿Å¿ion, without delay to enquire for more, and Å¿o we are agreed in the maine about the mater of the ViÅ¿ible Church: We differ in this that he thinks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons are not to be admitted, but under the conÅ¿ideration of perÅ¿ons judged, at leaÅ¿t probably, Converted and Regenerated. My mind is that they are to be admitted under the name of Å¿erious, Å¿ober, outward profeÅ¿Å¿ours, abÅ¿tracting from ConverÅ¿ion or non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ion.

What the good man Å¿ayeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 84. <hi>materialls of new gathered Churches with us, are Å¿uch as have been converted by MiniÅ¿ters in their Å¿everall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,</hi> With reverence of his memorie be it Å¿poken, is chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿h and nothing to the purpoÅ¿e, for firÅ¿t, the QueÅ¿tion is not how or by what means, <hi>de facto</hi> this or that man is converted, but what followeth upon his Tenet: And according to the genius of this it followeth clearly that all are Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be converted (we Å¿peak of ConverÅ¿ion ordinarily) before ever they come under a MiniÅ¿try, and Å¿o by privat ChriÅ¿tians. And theÅ¿e Å¿ome, of whom you ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Congregations, having them from under other MiniÅ¿ters, in their Å¿everall Congregations, if theÅ¿e Congregations be rightly conÅ¿titute, according to your principles, were converted ere ever they came under Å¿uch MiniÅ¿ters.</p>

                     <hi>Argument</hi> 5. If the mater of the ViÅ¿ible Church were only reall Saints and the complexion of the ViÅ¿ible Church true holines and Å¿aving grace (as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> roundly expreÅ¿Å¿eth in his Tenet, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. and that by expreÅ¿Å¿e oppoÅ¿ition to <hi>Å¿eemingly good, pag.</hi> 25.) or Å¿uch as are poÅ¿itively to be judged Å¿uch by evidence Å¿o far as men very Å¿pirituall can diÅ¿cern (as other where he expreÅ¿Å¿eth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106774:88"/> it) then it doth follow that a man being in the ViÅ¿ible Church, for non-regeneration <hi>Å¿imply</hi> or non-appearance, or defect of poÅ¿itive evidence to ground a poÅ¿itive judgement of his Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ought to be Excommunicat and caÅ¿ten out of the ViÅ¿ible Church; but the conÅ¿equent is falÅ¿e: <hi>Ergo</hi> the antecedent alÅ¿o. The connexion of the propoÅ¿ition M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> cannot deny, for in effect it is his own, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. where he Å¿ayeth Excommunication is an Ordinance to cleanÅ¿e the HouÅ¿e of God and keep it pure, and according to what it ought to be Å¿o far as men can diÅ¿cern, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Tenet, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of only reall Saints, and not one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And Å¿ayeth expreÅ¿ly that if men creep in, where they Å¿hould not be (<hi>i. e.</hi> if men not Regenerat creep into the ViÅ¿ible Church) they are to be caÅ¿t out. 'Tis true, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. in the end of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, he mincheth the mater, and Å¿ayeth only, <hi>not one known to be otherwiÅ¿e can abide within.</hi> But he Å¿hould have Å¿aid, by the conÅ¿equence of his Tenet, not one, <hi>not known poÅ¿itively, to be Å¿uch, &amp;c.</hi> As to the AÅ¿Å¿umption, that it is falÅ¿e, that for non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation Å¿imply, or defect of poÅ¿itive evidences of Regeneration, perÅ¿ons are to be caÅ¿t out of the ViÅ¿ible Church. 1. BecauÅ¿e there is neither precept nor practice in the Word of God for caÅ¿ting out any upon this account. Let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> produce us any thing from Scripture of this kind. The Scripture enjoyneth Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication for obÅ¿tinacie, in known publick Å¿candalous Å¿ins in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation, or hereÅ¿ie in Doctrine, or at moÅ¿t for atrocious crimes (whether the perÅ¿ons be judged Converts and Regenerats or not) but no mention of any other cauÅ¿e of Excommunication: And in maters <hi>de jure</hi> in Religion, a negative Argument from Scripture, is Å¿ure, 'tis not commanded, 'tis not written in Scripture, <hi>Ergo</hi> it ought not to be done. I do profeÅ¿Å¿e this conÅ¿equent following upon this opinion is one of the conÅ¿iderations amongÅ¿t others, that of a long time has Å¿wayed me to think, that 'tis a way which is not of God: But on the contrary (tho I eÅ¿teem reverently of many of the followers of it and has no harÅ¿h thoughts of their intentions therein) that 'tis a Å¿ubtile device of Satan transforming himÅ¿elf into an Angel of light, Å¿et on foot by him as to advance AtheiÅ¿m in the World, Å¿o in Å¿peciall to overturn the ProteÅ¿tant Religion and Churches. For if none Å¿hall be permitted to be members of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106774:88"/> ViÅ¿ible Churches, but Å¿uch as are reall Saints, at leaÅ¿t Å¿o far as men very Å¿pirituall can diÅ¿cern and judge upon Å¿uch evidences, as theÅ¿e of this way holdeth forth. TheÅ¿e being in all parts the far feweÅ¿t number even very few in compariÅ¿on: all the reÅ¿t (of whom yet, many may have Å¿ome Å¿eeds of true Å¿aving grace in them, albeit it be not Å¿o perceptible to others) tho they were not outwardly contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againÅ¿t the Ordinances, muÅ¿t be un-Churched, caÅ¿ten out, to be no more under any PaÅ¿torall care, for watching over their Å¿ouls; to live as they like, without any Å¿pirituall means, to reÅ¿train or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them: to be a ready prey to Satan and his inÅ¿truments, to be turned Å¿ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Argument</hi> 6. That Doctrine which tends unavoidably to the holding out from the fellowÅ¿hip of the viÅ¿ible Church, and Å¿o from all the ordinary means of grace and Å¿alvation inÅ¿tituted by ChriÅ¿t, not only many who may be the elect of God, and whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but probably judge to be elect: but alÅ¿o many, who may have Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure of true Regenerating grace in them, and yet leaves a door open to any Reprobat hypocrite (whom it pretends, ought not to be there) to come in if they can but diÅ¿Å¿emble well and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it fair outwardly; that Doctrine, I Å¿ay, it Å¿eemeth, cannot be from God. But that Doctrine concerning the neceÅ¿Å¿ary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Church-members, aÅ¿Å¿erted and maintained by Mr. <hi>Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier</hi> is Å¿uch: therefore, &amp;c. The propoÅ¿ition I conceive will not be denyed by any who will conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e things. 1. That the means of grace and Å¿alvation, the Ordinances of God, are inÅ¿titute and Å¿et up in the Church, <hi>primarly and per Å¿e,</hi> for the elects Å¿ake, that they may obtain Å¿alvation. Hence is that of the ApoÅ¿tle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 10. <hi>Therefore I endure all things for the Elects Å¿ake, that they may alÅ¿o obtain Å¿alvation which is in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, with eternall glory:</hi> Notable are the words of that Judicious PopiÅ¿h Commentator <hi>EÅ¿tius</hi> upon the words, <hi>ideo (GraecÃ¨, propter hoc</hi>)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106774:89"/> 
                     <hi>i. e. ut Euangelium diÅ¿Å¿eminetur ut Verbum Dci currat &amp; clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficetur</hi> (acutelie pondering the connexion of this <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> with the end of the preceeding, <hi>but the Word of God is not bound) omnia dura Å¿uffero, nullum laborem refugio, idque propter electos: Quamvis enim reprobi Å¿int electis permixti &amp; eadem officia per EccleÅ¿iae MiniÅ¿tros impen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dantur reprobis, ut Doctrina, oratio, exhortatio, correptio, Sacramentorum AdminiÅ¿tratio: Non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men propter reprobos Å¿ed propter electos fiunt.</hi> And a little after, <hi>MiniÅ¿tros utique oportet cum Paulo in univerÅ¿o Å¿uo MiniÅ¿terio</hi> (and Å¿o in receiving into the ViÅ¿ible Church) <hi>hoc ipÅ¿um intendere.</hi> 2. That as it is ChriÅ¿t the great and chief PaÅ¿tor, his own way not to quench the Å¿moking flax, Å¿o it is his will that his Å¿ervants and MiniÅ¿ters Å¿hould not doit; but that they Å¿hould receive theÅ¿e that are infirm and weak. Now it being Å¿o; can any man think that, that way can be of ChriÅ¿t, whereby the entrance into the ViÅ¿ible Church, and Å¿o to the benefit of the publick Ordinances, which are the ordinary means of obtaining Å¿alvation, is made Å¿o Å¿trait, that many elect and Å¿uch as, we cannot but probably judge to be Å¿uch may he held forth from the benefit of all theÅ¿e, Å¿hut out of the ordinary way of Å¿alvation: Yea and even many, who may have beginnings of the true grace of Regeneration. If this were not a way to quench Å¿moaking flaxes I know not what will be.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>29</label> As for the truth of the aÅ¿Å¿umption, I make it clear thus 1. As to the former part many of theÅ¿e who profeÅ¿Å¿e outwardly the faith, willingneÅ¿Å¿e to joyn in fellowÅ¿hip with the ViÅ¿ible Church, and to Å¿ubject themÅ¿elves to Ordinances, may be of the elect of God. This cannot be denyed, yea nor can we but account them who comes this far on (tho we cannot yet poÅ¿itively Å¿ay we account them actually Regenerat men) probably to be elect. Yet by Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Doctrine, tho perÅ¿ons profeÅ¿Å¿e the faith, be deÅ¿irous of the fellowÅ¿hip of the Church, declare willingneÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿ubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to the Ordinances; Yet unleÅ¿Å¿e they be truely Converted, and Regenerat, Å¿ealed of God by his Spirit for his, Å¿o far as men very Å¿pirituall can diÅ¿cern, they are not to be admitted into the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible Church, and are held forth from the benefit of all the publick Ordinances, the ordinary means of Å¿alvation. 2. As to the other part, 'tis alÅ¿o clear thus; becauÅ¿e there may be many Å¿moaking
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106774:90"/> flaxes, who have Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure of true grace in them, who yet not only are weak in knowledge, unable to give an account of all the fundamentalls of Religion, and Å¿uch points as are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to lead a life without Å¿candall (which yet are required as the ground of that judgement our adverÅ¿aries will have to paÅ¿Å¿e upon perÅ¿ons, to be admitted members of the ViÅ¿ible Church) but alÅ¿o under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Å¿enÅ¿ible, Å¿infull infirmities, which may render them Å¿uÅ¿pected to others, to be no reall Saints, may puzle others to paÅ¿Å¿e judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them, at leaÅ¿t, may put them to a Å¿uÅ¿pence from paÅ¿Å¿ing a poÅ¿itive judgement upon them, as true Å¿aints, Å¿ealed of God for his, by his Spirit. And all Å¿uch by Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Doctrine muÅ¿t be held forth from the ViÅ¿ible Church, and Å¿o from the benefit of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances, the ordinary means of Salvation. TheÅ¿e two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderations, I profeÅ¿Å¿e have been to me further motives to make me think the way held forth by this Doctrine concerning the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, <hi>in foro EccleÅ¿iae,</hi> of Church members, not to be of ChriÅ¿t, it being Å¿o obÅ¿tructive to the proper end and deÅ¿ign of the Å¿etting up of the Ordinances and means of grace in the Church, and contrary to ChriÅ¿ts own way of dealing with Å¿ouls, and yet no caÅ¿t-away or unregenerat man Å¿hall be excluded, if he but be Å¿tudied in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of theologie, and can carie it fair before men, as indeed hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriÅ¿ie may Å¿tand with great externall formalities of Religion, in word and converÅ¿ation.</p>

That Å¿uch perÅ¿ons may be hearers of the Word, tho they be not admitted members of the ViÅ¿ible Church, <hi>we admit</hi> Å¿ay they <hi>even infidels to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word.</hi> To this I think Reverend Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> has Å¿aid truely, that to be admitted as ordinary hearers of the Word, and Church prayers, is a degree of admiÅ¿Å¿ion to Church-memberÅ¿hip; and they who are baptized, and ordinarly hear and profeÅ¿Å¿e a willing mind to communicat with the Church in the Holy things of God, they, being not Å¿candalouÅ¿ly wicked, ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yea are members of the ViÅ¿ible Church. But 2. To Å¿ay that men are not members of the ViÅ¿ible Church and yet that they may be ordinary hearers of the Word, according to your principles is but a fair word to make Children fain of nothing. For Å¿ay ye, a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106774:91"/> MiniÅ¿ter is a MiniÅ¿ter only in relation to his particular flock and the members thereof, therefore Å¿ay I, as a MiniÅ¿ter he is to Preach the Word only to them, and therefore he muÅ¿t Å¿ute his Preaching of the Word unto them, that is unto men Å¿ealed of God by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Å¿o far as men very Å¿pirituall can diÅ¿cern, and Å¿o as a MiniÅ¿ter or a MiniÅ¿teriall Preacher of the Word, he is not obliged to bring any word for hearing, for the caÅ¿e of that man that is not a member, and Å¿o if that man hear ordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ar) any Preaching of the Word fitted or prepared to do him good, 'tis more through hap then good guiding, as we Å¿ay; or elÅ¿e you muÅ¿t Å¿ay, that a MiniÅ¿ter when he is to Preach the Word, he muÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and Å¿tudy Å¿omething as a MiniÅ¿ter, for ViÅ¿ible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Å¿uteable to Å¿uch; and Å¿omething to Preach as a privat gifted man for Å¿uch as are without. But 1. An ordinary Preacher of the Word as a privat ChriÅ¿tian, is a Preacher unknown to Scripture. 2. And one and that Å¿ame man Preaching at that Å¿ame time, as a MiniÅ¿ter to Å¿ome, and as a privat man to other hearers, is far more uncouth to cripture. I beleeve a MiniÅ¿ter by Scripture rule, ought in his ordinary and publick Preaching of the Word, to act and Preach as a MiniÅ¿ter, and to be wholly taken up with the work of his MiniÅ¿try: For to that he is appointed of God, and commanded to look to and fulfill, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>ColloÅ¿.</hi> 4. 17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.</p>

It is Å¿aid by Å¿ome of them that they will receive any in whom they Å¿ee the leaÅ¿t thing of ChriÅ¿t, and therefore there is no Å¿uch hazard of holding out perÅ¿ons that have not true grace in them. To this, that leaÅ¿t thing of ChriÅ¿t is Å¿ome outward evidence to ground a poÅ¿itive judgement, that the man is Regenerat. Now I inquire what is that leaÅ¿t thing of ChriÅ¿t, upon Å¿ight whereof. you Å¿ay you will receive men?

If you Å¿aid the former, we were at agreement, upon the mater, about the qualification neceÅ¿Å¿ary <hi>in Å¿oro EccleÅ¿iae,</hi> for admitting of perÅ¿ons to be Church members: but this you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not to be Å¿ufficient: Let men thus Å¿eriouÅ¿ly and Å¿ober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Shall be taken from theÅ¿e deÅ¿criptions of the ViÅ¿ible Church in the Word of God holding it forth to us frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a mixed Å¿ociety of good and bad, under the Å¿imilitudes of a barn floore, wherein is an heap of wheat and chaffe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. of a corn field wherein are growing together tares and wheat, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 24. of a draw-net gathering in good fiÅ¿h and bad, <hi>ibid. verÅ¿.</hi> 47. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of a great houÅ¿e wherein are veÅ¿Å¿els of Gold and Silver, and veÅ¿Å¿els of Wood and Earth, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2. 21. I confeÅ¿Å¿e this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hath not been well managed againÅ¿t the oppoÅ¿ites, which has given them occaÅ¿ion to Å¿light it, as proving nothing but what themÅ¿elves grant. For when no more is alledged from theÅ¿e places, but that the ViÅ¿ible Church is Å¿uch a Å¿ociety, as even when rightly conÅ¿titute, there are in it a mixture of true beleevers and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, they Å¿ay they yeeld the Argument wholly, that in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t ViÅ¿ible Churches, there may and will alwayes be a mixture of hypocrites with true beleevers and Saints, <hi>de facto:</hi> but that the QueÅ¿tion is what Å¿ort of perÅ¿ons ought, <hi>de jure</hi> to be admitted or
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106774:92"/> permitted to be members of the ViÅ¿ible Church. But the places duely pondered and conÅ¿idered together will afford us a more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Argument, which will not leave open a way for Å¿uch an eÅ¿cape. We preÅ¿ent it thus in form: if the Lord himÅ¿elf deÅ¿cribing the outward conÅ¿titution of the ViÅ¿ible Church, as to the mater where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it conÅ¿iÅ¿teth; not only holdeth it forth as a mixed Å¿ociety of Å¿ome truely good, and gracious, and Å¿ome bad unconverted and graceleÅ¿Å¿e ones: But alÅ¿o declareth that his will is that his Å¿ervants Å¿hould not caÅ¿t out of it all Å¿uch as they conceive to be bad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, but that they permit even Å¿uch in the outward ViÅ¿ible Church, leaving to himÅ¿elf to make the full Å¿eparation of the one from the other: Then it cannot be that by his apointment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution, it Å¿hould be the neceÅ¿Å¿ary qualification of ViÅ¿ible Church-members, <hi>in foro EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tico,</hi> that they be all true converts and gracious ones, at leaÅ¿t, Å¿o far as men can diÅ¿cern and judge, this propoÅ¿ition if the conÅ¿equence and connexion thereof hold good; leaves no door open for the former eÅ¿capes, as is evident: and I conceive that the connexion or conÅ¿equence of it, is undenyable, becauÅ¿e upon the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition of the oppoÅ¿ite of the conÅ¿equent fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes clearly the oppoÅ¿ite of the antecedent, that is to Å¿ay, if it were ChriÅ¿ts inÅ¿titution and will that true grace, at leaÅ¿t, Å¿o far as men can diÅ¿cern and judge, Å¿hould be the neceÅ¿Å¿ary qualification, <hi>in foro EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tico,</hi> of all Church-members, it Å¿hould clearly follow that it were his will, and the duty of his Å¿ervants to caÅ¿t out all Å¿uch in the ViÅ¿ible Church, as they did Å¿ee not to be qualified, not gracious converts, which is flatly contrary to that which is Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed in the antecedent.

The Book is common, Å¿o that I need not tranÅ¿cribe all; I Å¿hall but bring two or three of them for Å¿uch as may be has not the Book at hand. 1. The externall ViÅ¿ible

The raÅ¿h zeal of Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants before they conÅ¿ult their Lord and MaÅ¿ter is ready with the hazard of the Church and true members thereof, to have Å¿uch a conÅ¿titution of the ViÅ¿ible Church as they Å¿hould Å¿uffer none to be a member, who are not inwardly Regenerat: But have all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of whoÅ¿e inward Regeneration they are not aÅ¿Å¿ured plucked from among ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours. 6.

For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Doctrine is that none others, no not one other, are fit mater of a ViÅ¿ible Church, but Å¿uch as are truly converted, Å¿o far as men truely converted and very Å¿pirituall are able to diÅ¿cern and judge: This is a thing that cannot be Å¿poken or underÅ¿tood of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If they acknowledge the being and eÅ¿Å¿ence thereof, then why do they not define the qualification of members in relation to it; but in relation to a Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> a particular Congregation? Is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary

Why have they not defined that blameleÅ¿Å¿e and GoÅ¿pel like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour which is requiÅ¿ite to be a ground of eÅ¿teeming perÅ¿ons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, what at leaÅ¿t is requiÅ¿ite and muÅ¿t concurre to make it up, and leÅ¿Å¿e then which will not Å¿erve? That Å¿o we might have the generall determinat rule, whereby cognition is to be made and eÅ¿timation to be paÅ¿Å¿ed upon all profeÅ¿Å¿ours of the truth, that they are beleevers, or otherwayes. For certainly while as they Å¿ay, but indefinitly, <hi>Å¿uch a blameleÅ¿Å¿e and GoÅ¿pel behaviour,</hi> and tells not what is requiÅ¿ite to make up Å¿uch a behaviour, they leave the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

If they Å¿ay they were writing an EpiÅ¿tle to friends, and could not therein Å¿ay all that is to be Å¿aid in the mater. I AnÅ¿wer, that, if they could have told it, it might been Å¿aid in Å¿hort bounds, and it was as neceÅ¿Å¿ary for clearing their mind, to have been told as the TheÅ¿is, they have Å¿et down, it Å¿elf. But yet let them point us to Å¿uch a rule in the Word, if they know where it lyeth. For my part, I profeÅ¿Å¿e humbly, I could never yet Å¿ee in the Word of God, an univerÅ¿all definite rule whereby judgement may and ought to be paÅ¿Å¿ed upon all and every profeÅ¿Å¿our of the truth, by others, that they are to be held for true beleevers or otherwiÅ¿e. 5. When as in the deÅ¿ignation of the perÅ¿ons that are fit to be admitted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ViÅ¿ible Church, they with Parents, joyn their children. I do heartily acknowledge their Orthodoxy in this, beyond others of that way, who have omitted wholly that addition, and wiÅ¿hes they may continue in that point of truth, conÅ¿idering how eaÅ¿ie it is, as the Authors of that EpiÅ¿tle themÅ¿elves may perceive by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in others that went off with them firÅ¿t, by that Å¿tep they have gone on to Å¿lide into that other of excluding the Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers from the ViÅ¿ible Church.

If they Å¿ay the former, they are at a diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement with others of the Independent way. If they Å¿ay the latter, then we muÅ¿t have another diÅ¿tinction of conÅ¿titute mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Å¿o many Å¿orts of members of the ViÅ¿ible Church, and Å¿o alÅ¿o, we muÅ¿t have many Å¿orts of qualifications of members.</p>

For my part I could never yet Å¿ee any inÅ¿tance of this kind, but on the contrary; finds, that perÅ¿ons, as Å¿oon as they once embraced the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the ChriÅ¿tian faith, albeit to that very time their behaviour had been moÅ¿t blameable, were forthwith baptized and Å¿o admitted members into the ChriÅ¿tian Church.

                     <hi>the Temple of the Holy GhoÅ¿t which is in you, you are not your own, you are bought with a price, this is an Argument taken from the condition of the perÅ¿ons whom he exhorteth thus. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is to all the Church of Corinth. Therefore they were all Å¿uch as the ApoÅ¿tle judged in charity the redeemed of the Lord. AnÅ¿w.</hi> Remember what we have Å¿aid before, that tho all were granted that is here alledged, yet the main point in QueÅ¿tion touching the conÅ¿titution of theÅ¿e Churches is not proven. The main point in QueÅ¿tion is upon what formall conÅ¿ideration only, the members of which theÅ¿e Churches did conÅ¿iÅ¿t, were received and admitted into the conÅ¿titution thereof. But the moÅ¿t that can be made out of what is alledged here, let it all be granted, is, that all the members were Å¿uch <hi>de facto</hi> and <hi>eventually;</hi> this being remembered, to the preÅ¿ent purpoÅ¿e. 1. SuppoÅ¿e it were granted, and that the reaÅ¿ons alledged did prove, that theÅ¿e titles, as given to the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> were to be underÅ¿tood as the Authors will, of all and every one in theÅ¿e Churches, that they were judged by the ApoÅ¿tle in charity, the Redeemed of the Lord, truly Å¿anctified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is hereby clear and evinced that Å¿o theÅ¿e titles, muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood alÅ¿o, when they are given to the other Churches founded by the ApoÅ¿tles? I know the chief Author of the EpiÅ¿tle has more skill (however it be with others of them) in Logick, then to think Å¿o, and hopes he doth not Å¿o deÅ¿piÅ¿e others that have any tolerable knowledge that way, as to think they would take Å¿uch a thing off his hand, and therefore wonders, that having undertaken to prove that all the Churches founded by the ApoÅ¿tles, were conÅ¿titute of Å¿uch members as were all poÅ¿itively judged in charity, Redeemed and Sanctified, becauÅ¿e of the titles of Redeemed and Sanctified given to them: And then that theÅ¿e titles given to them, muÅ¿t not be underÅ¿tood <hi>Å¿ynecdochically</hi> by a denomination taken from the better part; but of all and every one of them: In the proof of this he brings in two of them, without Å¿o much as one word of aÅ¿Å¿ay to prove the like of the reÅ¿t. If it Å¿hal be Å¿aid that if that be proven of one or two, it is proven alÅ¿o by conÅ¿equence of the reÅ¿t. I deny it, for the QueÅ¿tion being about the Å¿enÅ¿e wherein a title aÅ¿cribed to Å¿everall particular Societies, whether, <hi>viz.</hi> it be aÅ¿cribed to them <hi>univerÅ¿ally</hi> as competent to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106774:98"/> all and every individuall contained therein; Or only by a deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination taken from a better part of theÅ¿e individualls? To prove that is to be Å¿o or Å¿o underÅ¿tood of one or two of them, is not Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to conclude, that Å¿o it is to be underÅ¿tood of the reÅ¿t: If yet it Å¿hall be replied, that there is no reaÅ¿on why it Å¿hould not be Å¿o underÅ¿tood of the reÅ¿t of theÅ¿e Churches, as of theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ed. I anÅ¿wer this much at leaÅ¿t Å¿hould have been alledged (which is not) to have made the Argument in appearance, at leaÅ¿t, to have Å¿ome force for the main point intended. But what if, tho it Å¿hould be granted that theÅ¿e titles are attributed to the two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches expreÅ¿Å¿ed here, are to be underÅ¿tood as Å¿poken of them <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ally:</hi> yet it Å¿hall be Å¿hown that in Å¿ome other of theÅ¿e Churches founded by the ApoÅ¿tles, there were perÅ¿ons to whom theÅ¿e titles could not be applyed? We conceive this hath been done before in our anÅ¿wer to Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> particularly of the Church of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> and that the 2 and 3. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> hold the Å¿ame clearly forth of Å¿ome others. But 2. as for that brought for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we refer to what we have anÅ¿wered before to M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Lockier,</hi> in that Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e. 3. As to the Argument brought to prove that the title of Redeemed (and conÅ¿equently the reÅ¿t) is given to all and every one of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> it lyeth thus in form as propounded by the Authors themÅ¿elves. The ApoÅ¿tle exhorting the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to flee fornication, taketh an Argument from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the perÅ¿ons whom he exhorteth (to wit that they were Redeemed) but the exhortation is to all the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Therefore they were all Å¿uch as the ApoÅ¿tle judged in charity to be Redeemed of the Lord. <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> I wonder exceeding much, that Å¿uch a looÅ¿ly formed Argument Å¿hould have come from the hand of Å¿uch a PhiloÅ¿ophe, as I take to have been the principall Author of this EpiÅ¿tle; for take it as it lyeth here, it looketh not like a peece of arte, a Å¿yllogiÅ¿m conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of three terms: but Å¿eemeth to have Å¿ome more. But to take it in the moÅ¿t candid way, I conceive it may be reÅ¿olved into thoÅ¿e two proceÅ¿Å¿es to make it formall, the firÅ¿t may be thus, all theÅ¿e to whom the ApoÅ¿tles exhortation to flee fornication there is directed, are by him called Redeemed: And Å¿o were at leaÅ¿t to his judgement of charity. But to all the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is that exhortation of the ApoÅ¿tles directed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106774:99"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other is for proof of the major or firÅ¿t propoÅ¿ition of that, thus: TheÅ¿e perÅ¿ons who are exhorted to flee fornication by an Argument taken from Redemption as their condition are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Redeemed by the ApoÅ¿tle: But all theÅ¿e to whom that exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is directed are exhorted by an Argument taken from that condition. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now then to <hi>AnÅ¿wer.</hi> 1. I think the aÅ¿Å¿umption of the firÅ¿t Å¿yllogiÅ¿m may well be denyed; <hi>viz.</hi> that exhortation is directed to all and every one in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> the Authors prove it not; Only they think it Å¿o evident, that none will deny it. But for what reaÅ¿on they are Å¿o confident of this I know not, unleÅ¿Å¿e it be this, that flying fornication was a duety incumbent to them all and every one of them. But this reaÅ¿on is not conÅ¿tringent; for why may not a duty, which is in a common obligation incumbent to all, be preÅ¿Å¿ed upon Å¿ome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar perÅ¿ons by an exhortation particularly intended and directed for them? I can Å¿ee no circumÅ¿tance in the Text here, why we may not conceive this exhortation, tho to a duty of common obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, yet particularly intended and directed by the ApoÅ¿tle to the elect and truely redeemed amongÅ¿t them, not diÅ¿tinctly by the head and name pointing them out, but <hi>confuÅ¿Ã¨,</hi> in the ViÅ¿ible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety they were amongÅ¿t. 2. PaÅ¿Å¿ing that aÅ¿Å¿umption of the firÅ¿t Å¿yllogiÅ¿m: the aÅ¿Å¿umption of the Å¿econd which is brought to prove the major of the firÅ¿t, is as looÅ¿e, <hi>viz.</hi> that all theÅ¿e perÅ¿ons to whom the exhortation is directed, or are exhorted to flee fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are exhorted by that Argument taken from redemption as their condition. This may well be denyed, for why may not an exhortation to a common duty, directed to a whole Å¿ociety mixed of perÅ¿ons of different Å¿pirituall conditions, be preÅ¿Å¿ed upon all by Å¿ome Arguments common to all (Å¿uch as that whereby this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is preÅ¿Å¿ed, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 18.) and upon Å¿ome, by Å¿ome Å¿peciall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument relating properly to them. There can be no circumÅ¿tance of the context alledged to prove, why it may not be conceived to be Å¿o here, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing that the exhortation is directed to all? But, 3. To beat out the bottom of this Argument, I prove from the very Text it Å¿elf that the ApoÅ¿tle here Å¿peaking to the perÅ¿ons, whom he calleth redeemed, Å¿peaketh of them as Å¿uch in the verity of the thing or object, <hi>i. e.</hi> as truly and really redeemed and conÅ¿equently
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106774:99"/> cannot be conceived to Å¿peak it of all and every one in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as the Authors themÅ¿elves will confeÅ¿Å¿e, I doubt not. I prove it thus, theÅ¿e whom the ApoÅ¿tles calls Redeemed here, they are Å¿uch as might and ought themÅ¿elves to know, and be aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ured that they were Redeemed, and had the Spirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them. But only Å¿uch as are in real<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ty and <hi>the verity of the thing,</hi> Redeemed, &amp;c. may and ought to know and be aÅ¿Å¿ured of this of themÅ¿elves. Therefore the Å¿econd Part of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is clear, becauÅ¿e otherwiÅ¿e a man might and ought to know and be aÅ¿Å¿ured of a lie, concerning his eÅ¿tate, which is deluded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umption. The firÅ¿t part is alÅ¿o clear from the ApoÅ¿tles words, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>What? know ye not that your bodies are the Temples of the Holy GhoÅ¿t,</hi> &amp;c. That <hi>know ye not</hi> Å¿o frequently uÅ¿ed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle, eÅ¿pecially in theÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and in this very <hi>Chapter</hi> five times, imports a certain aÅ¿Å¿urance of the thing he is Å¿peaking of, and therefore here the ApoÅ¿tle imports that theÅ¿e whom he is Å¿peaking to as redeemed, and having the Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, they are Å¿uch as may and ought to be aÅ¿Å¿uredly Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible that they were redeemed. And is not this place parallel to that of the very like expreÅ¿Å¿ion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Know ye not that ChriÅ¿t is in you?</hi> Which all ProteÅ¿tant Divines preÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿ts for proving Believers certain aÅ¿Å¿urance and perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of grace and Å¿alvation. Therefore I conclude: That the ApoÅ¿tle by theÅ¿e whom he calls the Temple of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, underÅ¿tands them that are Å¿uch indeed and in truth of the object, and not in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity; And what an incongruous interpretation were it to put upon theÅ¿e words, <hi>Know ye not that ye are the temples of the Holy GhoÅ¿t redeemed with a price?</hi> this Å¿enÅ¿e; Know ye not that ye are accounted in the judgment of charity, temples of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Yet I think it cannot in truth be Å¿aid that all and every one in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were judged poÅ¿itively by the ApoÅ¿tle in the judgment of charity, gracious, renewed and Å¿anctified ones, even becauÅ¿e of the groÅ¿Å¿e wickedneÅ¿Å¿e he in theÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tles expreÅ¿Å¿eth himÅ¿elf to have known to be amongÅ¿t them.</p>

For it is moÅ¿t evident by comparing the EvangeliÅ¿ts, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> yea and <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 23. that great multitudes of people coming to him were baptized by him together, at the Å¿ame time. Now I pray how did <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿ee fruits meet for Repentance in all and every one of theÅ¿e by themÅ¿elves? was he acquaint with every one of their converÅ¿ations perÅ¿onall, before they came there, who will be Å¿o impudent as to hazard upon Å¿uch an aÅ¿Å¿ertion eÅ¿pecially, of him who lived in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e remote from their Cities and Societies?

Who will Å¿ay or beleeve this either? Or did <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿ee theÅ¿e, by examining every one of them Å¿everally, and cauÅ¿ing them make a declaration of the experimentall work of Repentance upon their heart? 1. But how could he do this, with Å¿o great multitudes, yea when all is done, this would be nothing but verball profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the work, and not fruits, Å¿poken of in the Text, which are reall good works and practices in life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation.

If this conÅ¿equence be good, then it muÅ¿t follow as well that MiniÅ¿ters cannot exert power of authoritative Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pel but with the joynt authoritative concurrence of the people in Preaching with them. For certain it is that the power of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the GoÅ¿pel is comprehended in theÅ¿e Keyes given to <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as the power of cenÅ¿ures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore if it follow, the power of the keyes was not given to <hi>Peter</hi> as an ApoÅ¿tle, nor as an Elder, but as a Believer: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Elders cannot exert power in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, cenÅ¿ures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the joint authorative concurrence of the body of ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours therein, it muÅ¿t follow alÅ¿o: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they cannot exert power in preaching the GoÅ¿pel without their joynt authoritative concurrence therein: and Å¿o when the MiniÅ¿ter prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, all the people muÅ¿t authoritatively preach with him, elÅ¿e his preaching is null. 2. But waving this, and granting it were true that the power of the keyes was firÅ¿t given to believers, and Å¿o to <hi>Peter,</hi> not as a MiniÅ¿ter, but as repreÅ¿enting Believers. I do not Å¿ee how it muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity follow that the body of ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours muÅ¿t act authoritatively, jointly with the Rulers in the exerting of that power. For we may Å¿uppoÅ¿e it was given to the body of the Church, not formally, but radically and virtually to be by them derived to Rulers to be formally exerted by theÅ¿e only, and then the conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will not follow; as, Å¿uppoÅ¿e it were true, which many Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, and with them Å¿ome Divines, maintain (which yet for my Å¿elf I cannot Å¿ee Å¿olide proof of) that the power of Civile Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is firÅ¿t given of God by a naturall right unto the body of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yet from this it followeth not, that no MagiÅ¿trates elected by people muÅ¿t exert power of Government without the joint autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative concurrence of the people with them; Then when ever a King is to exert an act of Government, or a Parliament, they muÅ¿t do nothing, unleÅ¿Å¿e the people Å¿it down upon the Throne or in the houÅ¿e with them, and thus no doubt Å¿undry Divines in former times, when they Å¿ay that the power of the Keyes were given firÅ¿t to the whole Church of beleevers, are to be underÅ¿tood to have

That the Reader may underÅ¿tand this myÅ¿tery the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 'tis to be obÅ¿erved, that when as hitherto in the Church of God, by the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, being underÅ¿tood the Ordinances of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t which he hath appointed to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿trate in his Church, or the power of adminiÅ¿tring theÅ¿e Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances under himÅ¿elf, theÅ¿e Keyes have been diÅ¿tributed unto the <hi>Key of Knowledge,</hi> or Doctrine, which is the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pel, taking in therewith the Sacraments as the Appendicles and Å¿eals of the GoÅ¿pel, and the <hi>Key of JuriÅ¿diction,</hi> or DiÅ¿cipline, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in CenÅ¿ures and abÅ¿olution from CenÅ¿ures: Independents of late have forged new Å¿orts of the Keyes, whereby they have confounded themÅ¿elves, and wound confound the whole Church of ChriÅ¿t in the mater of its Government.

Again Å¿ee another great variation. At firÅ¿t he propounds that the Keyes were given to <hi>Peter</hi> firÅ¿t as a beleever. This may import (and as Å¿poken there by the Author without any explication, cannot be otherwiÅ¿e underÅ¿tood but that it doth import) that they were given to him as a Å¿ingle beleever; but now in the conÅ¿equent inferred in the pretended proof, he Å¿ayeth thus, they were given firÅ¿t to <hi>the Church of beleevers,</hi> this is a Å¿ociety of perÅ¿ons collectively and unitedly taken, and not perÅ¿ons Å¿ingly. 2. Where Å¿hall we ever read, the Elders or MiniÅ¿ters called the Officers and Servants of the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, (as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> meaneth) by way of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church as a Superiour, or MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e, deputing and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to officiat and act in her place?

And now I muÅ¿t profeÅ¿Å¿e, I wonder much, that (after Å¿o many learned men have debated Å¿o much on that Text and brought Å¿o many conÅ¿iderable Arguments to prove that it cannot be meant in that place, that the power of the Keyes was given to <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿imply as a beleever, or to the Church of beleevers; And given Å¿o conÅ¿iderable anÅ¿wers to all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought by others to the contrair, a man of reputation) as <hi>Lockier,</hi> Å¿hould come forth with this poor one, that power was given to <hi>Peter</hi> upon confeÅ¿Å¿ion of his faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was given to him as a beleever, or under that reduplication, as if this were enough to daÅ¿h all, and in reaÅ¿on to convince all gain-Å¿ayers.

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ion propounded in the AÅ¿Å¿ertion was, that the Elders in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church are not to exert power in moÅ¿t weighty maters, as admiÅ¿Å¿ion of Members, ordination of Officers, Excommunication, without the conÅ¿ent and approbation of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> without the judiciall concurrence, conÅ¿ent, and joynt authoritative vote of the members. Now that which is inferred as the concluÅ¿ion here, that they have not an abÅ¿olute power over the Church, an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted power to do what they pleaÅ¿e with the Church, I appeal to all rationall men to give their judgement if this and that be all one. Why? May it not be that the Elders or Officers Å¿et over a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church may exert power in putting forth Å¿uch acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without the joynt authoritative conÅ¿ent and vote of the members of that Church, and yet notwithÅ¿tanding, not have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olute power over that Church, an exempted power to do with the Church what they pleaÅ¿e? Yes verily: for notwithÅ¿tanding that, they may in their exerting of power of theÅ¿e acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1. Only act MiniÅ¿terially and adÅ¿tricted to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite rule over which they have no power. And 2. if they in their exerting their power deviat from that rule and act contrary to the direction thereof, the members may have liberty, upon diÅ¿cerning, by the privat judgement of diÅ¿cretion to refuÅ¿e obedientiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent to them. 3. And there may be an authoritative power over
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106774:117"/> and above them to which they may be countable, who may au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively correct and redreÅ¿Å¿e their deviation, and to which the people may have recourÅ¿e for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ffect. And if Å¿o, then their exerting of power in the maters of Government tho without the joint judiciall and authoritative conÅ¿ent and vote of the members therein, is not an abÅ¿olute power, an exempted power to do with the Church what they pleaÅ¿e. And Å¿o indeed it is in our Doctrine. The power it allowes to Elders and Officers to exert acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                     </gap>ent, without joint judiciall authoritative conÅ¿ent of the members, is a MiniÅ¿teriall power adÅ¿tricted to a certain and Å¿ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign rule of ChriÅ¿ts Laws Å¿et down in his Word: It allowes to people a liberty, yea aÅ¿Å¿erts it to be their duety, to prove in the judgement of privat diÅ¿cretion, if the Officers in their actings of Government deviat from, or croÅ¿Å¿e the rule, or not; And in caÅ¿e they do, not to give their obedientiall conÅ¿ent therunto: And that there is authoritative power above the Elders of a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Author deals not ingenuouÅ¿ly enough, in inÅ¿inuating Å¿uch an aÅ¿perÅ¿ion upon our Doctrine, that by it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Elders of a Church an abÅ¿olute power over the Church, an exempted power to do with the Church what they pleaÅ¿e. But now judge if the Independent way (in that Å¿train of it followed by our Author) be not guilty of giving a power very like this to members over Officers: When as it allows to the members, or the greater part of the members, of a particular Congregation (which may be 3. or 4.) to cenÅ¿ure, depoÅ¿e, Excommunicat all their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers (which muÅ¿t be 3. at leaÅ¿t) by a Å¿upream Independent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without any Superiour Authority on earth left to have recourÅ¿e to for redreÅ¿Å¿e, were their proceeding and Å¿entence never Å¿o unjuÅ¿t, this I am Å¿ure is very abÅ¿olute, exempted, and lordly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like indeed. Well then, correct the concluÅ¿ion as it is inferred here, and reduce it to the more modeÅ¿t and ingenuous terms of the AÅ¿Å¿ertion.</p>

Again Å¿ee the clear Å¿trength of this proof comes to this much, the people ought to have a joynt authoritative conÅ¿ent and vote with their Rulers, the ElderÅ¿hip; Why?

It could been wiÅ¿hed that the Author had expreÅ¿Å¿ed, what are theÅ¿e tranÅ¿actions meerly prudentiall or not of generall concernment, or not of Å¿o great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106774:121"/> concernment, which he Å¿aith, belongeth properly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatly to the Officers or Elders; Which had he done I doubt not, but we Å¿hould have Å¿een, either maters of meer order, no wayes importing any Å¿uch power or authority, as Church Officers have attributed to them in the Word of God: But only Å¿uch as a Chair-man or Moderator of a Judicatory may do in relation to its judiciall proceedings, who yet as Å¿uch hath no authority over the Judicatory: Or Å¿ome of them to be Å¿uch tranÅ¿actions as are of as great generall concernment as any can be. I remember <hi>Hooker Surv. Part.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 41, 42. amongÅ¿t other things gives to the Elders as properly belonging to them, in mater of cenÅ¿ure and Excommunication, the Examination of the cauÅ¿e, and dogmaticall propounding of the Å¿entence, and Å¿ayes that the fraternity has no more power to oppoÅ¿e the Å¿entence of the cenÅ¿ure propounded by them, then they have to oppoÅ¿e their Doctrine delivered in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the GoÅ¿pel, and Å¿o that the one is as binding as the other. If theÅ¿e be not tranÅ¿actions, more then meerly prudentiall, of very great generall concernment. I profeÅ¿Å¿e, I know not what is. Nay, I affirme it, and it is evident, that hereby greater power is given to two or three Elders in a particular Congregation, then ever PreÅ¿by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians attiibuted, I Å¿ay not, to the Elders of a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but to any ClaÅ¿Å¿icall PreÅ¿bytery of many combyned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: For by the way of PreÅ¿byterians, when a ClaÅ¿Å¿icall ElderÅ¿hip has given forth Å¿entence of Excommunication, there may be an appeal to a more ample and Superiour Judicatory for judiciall recognition and redreÅ¿Å¿e. But here by this Independent way, power is given to two or three Elders to propound the Å¿entence of Excommunication, which the fraternity are bound to joyn with as much as to obey their Preaching, and there is no Å¿uperiour remedy of judiciall recognition and redreÅ¿Å¿e left to the party under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 4. If any maters of generall concernment wherein the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or hurt of every member is concerned, muÅ¿t be authoritatively tranÅ¿acted not by the ElderÅ¿hip alone, but by the members joyntly with them, I Å¿ee not why all maters of generall concernment ought not to be Å¿o alÅ¿o: <hi>Magis &amp; minus non variant Å¿peciem.</hi> But to come to the point wherin lyeth the proof of that, that it is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given and not taken when the members are offended, becauÅ¿e
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106774:122"/> they cannot by judiciall and authoritative vote, hinder the Å¿entence of the ElderÅ¿hip, the deciÅ¿ive Å¿entence lying only in the Elders. If becauÅ¿e, in theÅ¿e tranÅ¿actions the benefit or hurt <hi>of every member</hi> is generally and greatly concerned; Therefore it is an offence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven if they have not Å¿uch power of judiciall concurrence and vote in the Å¿entence: Then I Å¿ay women alÅ¿o muÅ¿t have this power and if they offend for want of it (as they are as ready as men to offend if they have not power to get their will) the offence is given and not taken; BecauÅ¿e women being members, are comprehended under that <hi>every member,</hi> and their benefit or hurt is concerned as well as mens. The Author will never be able to avoid this upon his <hi>medium.</hi> 6. If becauÅ¿e in theÅ¿e tranÅ¿actions, the benefit or hurt of every Member of the Church is generally and greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, when they are offended becauÅ¿e they cannot by judiciall and authoritative joint vote hinder the Å¿entence, the deciÅ¿ive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof lying only in the Elders, the offence is not taken but given, and therefore they ought to have Å¿uch vote, then Å¿ay I by as good conÅ¿equence, it followeth, becauÅ¿e in the great tranÅ¿acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in civill Government, Å¿uppoÅ¿e, by a Major and his counÅ¿ell, by a Parliament, the benefite or hurt of every member of the city or Common-wealth is generally and greatly concerned; If the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers offend that they cannot by joint authoritative vote hinder the Å¿entence, the deciÅ¿ive power thereof lying altogether in theÅ¿e Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, the offence is not taken but given; And therefore they ought to concur jointly and authoritatively in theÅ¿e tranÅ¿actions with their Governours. Here is again Levelling, backed with reaÅ¿on Å¿uch as it is. 7. Therefore to AnÅ¿wer directly, 'tis but a looÅ¿e and falÅ¿e principle, that in all tranÅ¿actions in which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite or hurt of perÅ¿ons is concerned, all perÅ¿ons whoÅ¿e the hurt or benefite is therein concerned, if they offend that they have not Å¿ufficient ability to hinder Å¿entence, by their joint authoritative vote, the offence is not taken but given, and therefore they ought to have Å¿uch joint authoritative concurrence and vote. Nay it tends to the everÅ¿ion of all Government and bringing in meer Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and confuÅ¿ion. Yet 8. I think from this rightly underÅ¿tood may be inferred Å¿omewhat which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> would conÅ¿ider in the mater of his next AÅ¿Å¿ertion. For if all whoÅ¿e benefite or hurt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106774:122"/> is greatly concerned in EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick tranÅ¿actions, ought to have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative joint concurrence in theÅ¿e tranÅ¿actions, then when as in Å¿ome main tranÅ¿actions in a particular Congregation, for example Excommunication, many others benefite or hurt is greatly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, beÅ¿ide theÅ¿e who are Members of the Congregation, it muÅ¿t follow that theÅ¿e others ought to have power of joint authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive concurrence in theÅ¿e tranÅ¿actions, or at leaÅ¿t Å¿ome for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rereÅ¿t ought to have Å¿uch power. And this I conceive will amount to the overturning of the Å¿upreme Independent tribunall (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> calls it, <hi>Part.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) of Å¿ingle Congregations; and Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up an EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick authoritative Judicatory over more Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>

That they Å¿hall judge the world, Angels, much more able to judge their own affairs:</hi> This is the one part of this Å¿ections Argument. There followeth another of which afterward. Now to this, 1. If this Argument hold good, then again Women, at leaÅ¿t Å¿ome Women, ought to have judiciall concurrence and vote jointly with the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip in tranÅ¿actions of Government. Why? the Å¿pirit of diÅ¿cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may be in as great meaÅ¿ure in Å¿ome Women, as in Å¿ome Men, and the greater will the gift be, when they with the Men are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and I think it will not be denyed that Women will be a part of the Saints who are to judge the World and Angels, 2. Upon the Å¿ame ground, by proportion, it followes, becauÅ¿e many private men may have the Å¿ame gift of diÅ¿cerning in a great meaÅ¿ure, that is in MagiÅ¿trates, in the Members of Parliament; Yea, may be, in a greater meaÅ¿ure in Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e then is in many of theÅ¿e, and there is a greater gift when all is joined together; Therefore all Å¿uch diÅ¿cerning men muÅ¿t have joint authoritative conÅ¿ent and vote, with MagiÅ¿trates, with the Parliament, in the Acts of Government. Here is again pleading for Levelling. 3. BecauÅ¿e Å¿ome men, may
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106774:123"/> be, have as great a meaÅ¿ure of knowledge and underÅ¿tanding for teaching the Word as MiniÅ¿ters, it followeth proportionally, upon that ground, that Å¿uch men may and ought to Preach authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as well as MiniÅ¿ters, and as Socinians, Å¿ome RemonÅ¿trants, and SeparatiÅ¿ts teach, a gifted man needs not an outward calling to be a MiniÅ¿ter; His gift is a calling Å¿ufficient. 4. To anÅ¿wer directly, to reaÅ¿on from a gift of diÅ¿cerning in maters coming under Acts of Government to actuall right and power to concur authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theÅ¿e Acts of Government, is a groÅ¿Å¿e and palpable <hi>non Å¿equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Let a man never have Å¿uch a meaÅ¿ure of a gift, for exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing Acts of Government or publick authority, he muÅ¿t beÅ¿ides, have the warrand of CommiÅ¿Å¿ion or calling to exert them, elÅ¿e if he take upon him to exert them, he is but an intruder, as all men will grant that are not againÅ¿t both Scripture light, and light of nature, and for turning all Affaires Civill and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick into a Chaos of confuÅ¿ion. 5. Whereas the Author, Å¿aying, <hi>their wil be a greater gift when</hi> all (Officers and private profeÅ¿Å¿ors) <hi>are joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, (viz.</hi> in theÅ¿e Acts of Government) <hi>in the name of ChriÅ¿t and his preÅ¿ence with them to diÅ¿cern and judge.</hi> We grant, that, when all private ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours with the Church Officers, are joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, poÅ¿Å¿ibly there may be a greater gift of diÅ¿cerning, by way of aggregation then when the Officers are alone: But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as withall it is tacitely Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, that all may meet in the name of the Lord (<hi>i. e.</hi> in his Authority) and may the more expect his preÅ¿ence for aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting the diÅ¿cerning &amp; judging in theÅ¿e maters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: in the former he begs the thing in queÅ¿tion, we deny that they do all meet for acts of Government in ChriÅ¿ts Authority; and in the latter Å¿uppoÅ¿es a great miÅ¿take, for the promiÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿ts aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting preÅ¿ence for judiciall and authoritative diÅ¿cerning and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, runs not equally along with the gift of diÅ¿cerning Å¿imply; But with his calling and commiÅ¿Å¿ion to govern. That <hi>loe I am with you to the end of the world,</hi> as to Acts of Government, is not made to perÅ¿ons having the gift of diÅ¿cerning, Å¿imply, tho never Å¿o many of them met together: But to perÅ¿ons who beÅ¿ide their gift, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veÅ¿ted with his CommiÅ¿Å¿ion. Therefore you muÅ¿t Å¿hew that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons have a CommiÅ¿Å¿ion and Calling, beÅ¿ide their gift, to exert Acts of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick authoritative judging: Or to Å¿peak of expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106774:123"/> of the Lords preÅ¿ence to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t their judging, let them be never Å¿o many, is to bid men preÅ¿ume to act with expectation of his aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿ting preÅ¿ence without a promiÅ¿e. There may be more of ChriÅ¿ts preÅ¿ence expected to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t a few having a Calling and CommiÅ¿Å¿ion from himÅ¿elf, in exerting Acts of Government; Then with a huge multitude though having gifts enough, but wanting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion. If it Å¿hall be Å¿aid that private ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours have a CommiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion to judge authoritatively with the ElderÅ¿hip in theÅ¿e maters of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick Government. 1. Then the <hi>medium</hi> of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is paÅ¿Å¿ed from, for it alleageth no more but the gift of diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, to prove they ought to concur in authoritative judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. This is but Å¿aid and begged, not proven; Shew us the authentick grant of that CommiÅ¿Å¿ion. This much for the firÅ¿t part of the Argument in this Section, he addeth further thus.</p>

See this aÅ¿perÅ¿ion diÅ¿covered and wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, before in our firÅ¿t SECT. and the Author in his own conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence knowes, may know, this is a wrong.

But 2. To the Argument propounded here, I Å¿ay 1. If it hold good, as in the former, it will follow that women muÅ¿t not be excluded from joynt authoritative concurrence in exerting power of Government
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106774:124"/> with the Elders more then men in the Church, Why? Women have their Å¿hare of the variety of gifts given to the Church, and Å¿ome of them a greater Å¿hare then many men, and light may come in by Å¿uch a weak hand as a woman, when, &amp;c. And Å¿o all this help of their Å¿hare of gifts will be made void if the managing be committed wholly to Elders and other men in the Congregation, and they left out, only to Å¿ee, &amp;c. And the very like Argument may, by proportion, be framed for admitting all privat perÅ¿ons in a Common-wealth to concur authoritavively in the Civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with MagiÅ¿trates. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the concluÅ¿ion here. If the ElderÅ¿hip or Rulers of the Church exert power in theÅ¿e acts of Government, without the joynt authoritative conÅ¿ent and vote of the people or other members, then the help which may be had to the whole, by that Å¿hare of that variety of gifts beÅ¿towed by ChriÅ¿t upon the Church, which is in the other members, Å¿hould be made void. But this ought not to be, <hi>Ergo,</hi> nor that. Now I deny the conÅ¿equence of the propoÅ¿ition, the Å¿hare of that variety of gifts given to the Church, which is in privat members may be of good uÅ¿e and help for the good of the whole, tho all of them do not concurre authoritatively in exerting or exerciÅ¿ing acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church. May not privat members make their Å¿hare of gifts forth-coming and helpfull for the good of the whole, by obÅ¿erving, inÅ¿tructing, exhorting, admoniÅ¿hing, and provoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to good works one another, in the privat extrajudiciall way of charity? Ay, but it may be Å¿aid the help of theÅ¿e gifts in them to the good of the whole in the way of authoritative acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made void. <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> This Å¿uppoÅ¿eth, that theÅ¿e gifts of privat members, are given to them by ChriÅ¿t, to be exerted for the good of the whole in the authoritative acting of Government, and that the authoritative actings of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For 1. If it Å¿hould be Å¿aid that <hi>Timothy</hi> was twice ordained: firÅ¿t to be a Presbyter, then to be an EvangeliÅ¿t, (as Å¿ome EpiÅ¿copall Writers Å¿ay to be a BiÅ¿hop: but a BiÅ¿hop diÅ¿tinct from a Presbyter is a humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature not in Scripture) and the firÅ¿t to be that, mentioned 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. done by the ordinary ElderÅ¿hip; The Å¿econd mentioned 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. done by <hi>Paul</hi> an ApoÅ¿tle, an extraordinary Officer above an EvangeliÅ¿t; I know not what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> will bring to infringe this. 2. SuppoÅ¿ing that he was but once ordained, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliÅ¿t and Elder both (as who ever was an EvangeliÅ¿t was alÅ¿o an Elder) yet an ordinary ElderÅ¿hip might concur with <hi>Paul</hi> in his Ordination, and the act of theÅ¿e ordinary Elders extend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to that which was common to him with other Elders, the Office of ElderÅ¿hip, that which was extraordinary flowing from the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Pauls</hi> concurrence in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e.

Yet further I Å¿ay with the worthy Author, I bring theÅ¿e things from, that I can Å¿ee no inconÅ¿iÅ¿tency or abÅ¿urdity, if it be Å¿aid that the Presbytery Å¿ent forth and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Timothy</hi> as an EvangeliÅ¿t: that it is alledged an EvangeliÅ¿t is an extraordinary Officer, and therefore the Elders being ordinary Officers could not give him a being, <hi>i. e.</hi> ordain him, I deny the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of the conÅ¿equence, any reaÅ¿on that can be brought to prove that conÅ¿equence muÅ¿t be, as I conceive, one of thoÅ¿e two, <hi>viz.</hi> Either, 1.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106774:142"/> be greater then an EvangeliÅ¿t, not Å¿imply and abÅ¿olutely, but Å¿o far as they bleÅ¿Å¿ed and ordained him? That Author gives two inÅ¿tances of the like, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 17. and <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1, 3. Or 2. the reaÅ¿on of that conÅ¿equence muÅ¿t be this: BecauÅ¿e, ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers not having in themÅ¿elves that extraordinar office, can not give that which they have not. And if this be it, I would then aske M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier,</hi> how can people give the Office of a MiniÅ¿ter which they have not in themÅ¿elves, nay, the Office of an ApoÅ¿tle, as he alledgeth that the people ordained <hi>Mathias</hi> an ApoÅ¿tle, whatÅ¿over he can anÅ¿wer for that will Å¿erve our turn for the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, ordaining <hi>Timothy</hi> to that Office, which they had not in themÅ¿elves. The truth is, mens ordaining a perÅ¿on to an EccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tick Office, not being by way of proper efficiency, nor yet the Ordainers acting therein as principal agents or conferrers of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (that is Gods part by his inÅ¿titution) but as morall inÅ¿truments under God: It is not, <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> requiÅ¿ite, that the ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have in themÅ¿elves formally the Office, whereunto they Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the perÅ¿on; But it is Å¿ufficient that they have a warrand from God to interveen as inÅ¿truments to apply the perÅ¿on to the Office inÅ¿tituted by God. And I Å¿ee nothing in the Office of an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliÅ¿t that can prove that ordinary Officers could have no warrand from God to act in this kind of cauÅ¿ality to the applying of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on to it.

And this ordination they acted alone: Therefore the ElderÅ¿hip, may do in moÅ¿t weighty things in the Church without the Church, without the joint conÅ¿ent of the Church. AnÅ¿w.</hi> We bring not theÅ¿e places for the generall, that Acts of Government belong to the Officers of the Church, <hi>only;</hi> To wit, to act therein authoritatively. But, for this particular, <hi>ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Again the Author propounds the concluÅ¿ion invidiouÅ¿ly, <hi>without the conÅ¿ent of the Church.</hi> We acknowledge that in theÅ¿e weighty matters the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the people, are to have a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall obedientiall conÅ¿ent, but privat; The QueÅ¿tion is whether they ought to have an authoritative deciÅ¿ive Å¿uffrage? And in the Calling of MiniÅ¿ters they ought to have Å¿uffrage in their election: But as for the poteÅ¿tative miÅ¿Å¿ion, or ordination, that, we Å¿ay, belongs to the Officers in the Church onely. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> It is to be obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how the Author labours to cover the force of theÅ¿e places for proving of this, by Å¿lipping by the principall words, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. <hi>and ordain Elders in every City,</hi> and produces only the words of the verÅ¿es following, expreÅ¿Å¿ing the qualifications requiÅ¿ite and to be preÅ¿uppoÅ¿ed in the perÅ¿ons that are to be ordained. In a word the argument from theÅ¿e places, is by him as Å¿lightly propounded,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:106774:143"/> as, I think, poÅ¿Å¿ibly he could. But let him take it thus. If ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of PaÅ¿tours by ApoÅ¿tolick authority be committed to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Church as Officers, then it belongeth not unto the people. But the former is proven from theÅ¿e places. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The PropoÅ¿ition is clear of it Å¿elf. The AÅ¿Å¿umption is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Texts. FirÅ¿t, <hi>Timothy</hi> is charged to lay hands Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on no man in that Å¿ame way, and under that Å¿ame conÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he is charged, not to receive an accuÅ¿ation againÅ¿t an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but upon two or three witneÅ¿Å¿es teÅ¿timony; And as he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to rebuke Å¿ins publickly, that others may fear; and that he is charged to obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e other Rules given to him for ordering his adminiÅ¿tration in the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. But theÅ¿e things are a charge given to him as a PaÅ¿tor: So by what power <hi>Titus</hi> was charged to rebuke the <hi>Cretians</hi> Å¿harply, that they might be Å¿ound in the faith, <hi>v.</hi> 13. By that Å¿ame power was he left in <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders in every City. But this he was to doe by an Official power, and as an Officer, as is evident by comparing that <hi>v.</hi> with <hi>v.</hi> 9. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, here is an expreÅ¿Å¿e CommiÅ¿Å¿ion to men in Office, to ordain, and charge laid upon them to be aware of doing it in a wrong way. Let the Author Å¿how me in all the New teÅ¿tament, a CommiÅ¿Å¿ion given to people to ordain MiniÅ¿ters, or a charge laid upon them to take heed how they ordain: But Å¿ee we now the Authors AnÅ¿wers to theÅ¿e places.</p>

AnÅ¿.</hi> We do juÅ¿tly charge that way of Church Government main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Author and his AÅ¿Å¿ociates, with this, that it Å¿ets up Å¿uch a Democratie or popular Government in the Church, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>French</hi> Church in <hi>Morellius:</hi> Which alÅ¿o Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents themÅ¿elves would fain Å¿eem to diÅ¿claime, but it will not be for them. The Author is pleaÅ¿ed in his wiÅ¿dome to propound the Argument for evidencing this, as Å¿lightly as he could: But let him take it thus; That Government in the Church wherein, albeit there be Å¿uch as bear the name of Officers and Rulers, yet not only all the power of Government is placed in the body of the people as in the firÅ¿t and proper Å¿ubject thereof, and not in their Officers; But alÅ¿o the whole body of the people formally and authoritatively, concur and act in the exerciÅ¿e of all the acts of Government, at leaÅ¿t all acts of juriÅ¿diction, Å¿o that all maters of this kind, are caried and determined by the authoritative Å¿uffrage, conÅ¿ent and diÅ¿Å¿ent of the people, nothing therein being left to the Officers as Officers, but to preÅ¿ide and moderate the body of the people in their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative acting, or, may be, to prepare and ripen maters for their authoritative deciÅ¿ion, and to be their mouth to declare the Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:106774:145"/> determined by their authority, yea and wherein, the body of the people, may authoritatively call all the Officers to a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall account, judicially cognoÅ¿ce upon their AdminiÅ¿tration, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure, degrade, yea and Excommunicate them all together, Å¿uch a Church Government muÅ¿t needs be Democraticall or popular, and therein all are Rulers and therein different names and Å¿tations Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing, (I Å¿ay not Å¿imply but as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi>) as to any diÅ¿tinct power of Authority. If any will deny the connexion of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition, I beÅ¿eech Å¿uch to give a deÅ¿cription of a popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sure I am that the very Government of Athens it Å¿elf, the moÅ¿t popular and Democratricall that we read of, was never more popular then that which we have expreÅ¿Å¿ed in the Antecedent or firÅ¿t part of the propoÅ¿ition.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>3</label> Now what anÅ¿wers the Author to this Objection? He brings us a number of words clouted up unhandÅ¿omely enough out of <hi>Hookers Surv. Par.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. which I think not worth the while to inÅ¿iÅ¿t particularly upon. Briefly, the Å¿umme of all comes to this: He tells us there is a power of <hi>Judging,</hi> to take in and to caÅ¿t out Members, to exert Office (he means to confer Office) or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade from Office, which he calls eÅ¿Å¿ential or fundamental power; And there is the maner of managing this, and exerting it: He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿eth it alÅ¿o, To declare, act and exerciÅ¿e judgment in the name of the reÅ¿t, which he calls organicall power, and <hi>PoteÅ¿tas Officii particularis.</hi> And tells us that that former power is common to the whole Church Elders and fraternity: The latter is in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (yet I cannot underÅ¿tand how this can Å¿tand with what he Å¿aith, that <hi>it lyeth formally in one:</hi> But be it Å¿o) And Å¿o their (to wit, the Elders) power is diÅ¿tinctly uÅ¿efull and Å¿ignificative. <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> To paÅ¿Å¿e by here the exagitating of that diÅ¿tinction of a power eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entiall and a power organicall (the abÅ¿urdity whereof in PhiloÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy might be Å¿hown abundantly, might we Å¿tay upon every Å¿uch triffle) and other Å¿uch <hi>minutias.</hi> Here, to the main purpoÅ¿e in hand. 1. To talk of, and Å¿uppoÅ¿e a power of judging, in taking in and caÅ¿ting out, inveÅ¿ting Officers and degrading them, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:106774:145"/> to the people and alÅ¿o exerciÅ¿ed by them formally, meaning, as he doth, of authoritative judging, is but a Å¿uppoÅ¿ing and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the main thing in QueÅ¿tion. The place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. proves it not, Tho the EpiÅ¿tle be written to the whole Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> yet not every command and direction there relates to all and every one in that Church, as to act formally in the work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or required. We Å¿ay that command of caÅ¿ting out the inceÅ¿tuous perÅ¿on judicially reÅ¿pects the Officers of that Church only. See this made good by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rutherfurd. Due Right. pag.</hi> 36, 37. <hi>Gul. Apollon. ConÅ¿ider. of certain controv. c.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 64, 65, 66. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Argument to the contrary, is weak; <hi>The ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ayeth caÅ¿t out from among you. But the inceÅ¿tuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on was not only amongÅ¿t the Elders, but among the people.</hi> What a poor Argument is this? Then it Å¿hould follow, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the Children Å¿hould judicially and authoritatively voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Excommunication of the inceÅ¿tuous perÅ¿on; For he was not only amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gÅ¿t the men; but alÅ¿o amongÅ¿t the Women and Children; TheÅ¿e, Å¿ure, were a part of the people. So then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the ApoÅ¿tle here, <hi>caÅ¿t out</hi> from amongÅ¿t you, tho Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in generall in the EpiÅ¿tle, yet in this particular command, muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood to be Å¿pe king with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Å¿uch in the Church as were inveÅ¿ted with a morall capacity of power and authority to act that which he was commanding. 2. When he Å¿ayeth the power of judging is common to the whole Church, Elders and fraternity, its but a fallacy as to Elders; For in effect Elders as Elders, by his way have no power of judging: As Å¿uch they have only the manner of managing the judgement. 3. When he expreÅ¿Å¿eth the act of eÅ¿Å¿entiall power (as he calleth it) competent to the whole Church, thus, <hi>Some to judge;</hi> and then the act of the Originall or Officiall power, thus, <hi>Some to declare, act and exerciÅ¿e that judgement:</hi> I would aske him what he meaneth by acting and exerciÅ¿ing judgement? Either it muÅ¿t be the determining of the judgement; But that is nothing elÅ¿e but judging it Å¿elf, which belongeth to the eÅ¿Å¿entiall power of the whole body: Or he muÅ¿t underÅ¿tand the execution of the Å¿entence, as for example, Å¿hunning the company of the Excommunicat; But that is no act of Office-power nor of authority, but is common to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106774:146"/> all the Church Men and Women: Or he muÅ¿t underÅ¿tand the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick uttering and pronouncing the Å¿entence of judgement: But that is juÅ¿t all one with declaring, and to call this acting and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ing of judgement, is very abuÅ¿ive Å¿peaking: Except theÅ¿e words be uÅ¿ed otherwiÅ¿e in EngliÅ¿h Language then I know of. But 4. The chiefeÅ¿t thing I would obÅ¿erve is, that the Author in Å¿aying much to the objection propounded, has Å¿aid juÅ¿t nothing, but in effect yeelded it wholly. For when as he Å¿ayeth that the power and exerciÅ¿e of judging, to wit, authoritatively (for of this, and not of judging by way of privat diÅ¿cretion is the preÅ¿ent diÅ¿courÅ¿e) belongeth equally to all the Church, and that the matter of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this only, belongeth to the Officers, what is this but as much as if he had Å¿aid in formall terms: 'Tis true, I yeeld it, the Government of the Church is Democraticall. And as for that he Å¿ayeth, that Å¿eeing the Elders have in their hands the manner of managing the judgement, <hi>therefore their power is uÅ¿efull and Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificative, and not uÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e and nothing from the whole.</hi> True, it is not Å¿imply uÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e and nothing Å¿ignificative. But Å¿ure I am it Å¿ignifies nothing as to any power of Authority and Government. A Mr. Speaker or PreÅ¿idents part in a Parliament, a Prolocutors or Moderators in an AÅ¿Å¿embly, is not Å¿imply uÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e and nothing, Å¿ignificative, but it is juÅ¿t nothing Å¿ignificative, as to Authority or Government.</p>

How the Å¿enÅ¿itive faculties may be Å¿aid to be all in the Å¿oul, originally, radically, and potentially, I can underÅ¿tand. The meaning being that the Å¿oul is the effective principle from which theÅ¿e faculties proceed by way of iÅ¿Å¿ue or emanation (as they call it) to have their Å¿ubjectation or inherency in their Å¿everall reÅ¿pective organs, and to Å¿ay this is not incongruous. But how the Å¿oul can be Å¿aid to be in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>fundamentally, radically and potentially,</hi> I cannot well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand. That the Å¿oul may be in Å¿ome one part of the body as in the heart (which Å¿ome) or brain (which others have thought)

                     <hi>Å¿ubÅ¿tantially</hi> and <hi>informative,</hi> and in the whole reÅ¿t of the body, <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>operativÃ¨,</hi> as the Sun which is Å¿ubÅ¿tantially and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in the Heavens, is in the Earth by its influence and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This I can conceive, and it is not altogether incongruous to Å¿ay Å¿o, though I think it be not true. But to Å¿ay the Å¿oul, eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Å¿oul of man, is in the whole body; fundamentally, radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and potentially, is Å¿uch a Å¿oloeciÅ¿me (to Å¿peak Å¿o) in philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ophy, as I think we Å¿hall hardly meet with one groÅ¿Å¿er amongÅ¿t men of any knowledge. For then, not only, does it follow that the Å¿oul muÅ¿t be by way of information, only in Å¿ome part of the body (which tho falÅ¿e, yet is not Å¿o untollerable) but alÅ¿o that the whole body is the effective principle from which the Å¿oul is produced and iÅ¿Å¿ues by way of emanation, into that part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which it is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to inform: Now how abÅ¿urd this is in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophy, yea in Divinity, let any judicious man conÅ¿ider of it. But yet I further wonder, that the Author, when he is expreÅ¿Å¿ing this his way of the Å¿ouls being in the whole body, to wit, <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, radically, &amp;c.</hi> he brings for it that common Å¿aying amongÅ¿t the Schooles, <hi>totain toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte:</hi> For indeed that is the proper expreÅ¿Å¿ion of their Doctrine who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Å¿oul is in the whole body, <hi>eÅ¿Å¿entially</hi> and <hi>informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivÃ¨,</hi> and withall that it is in it as a Å¿pirituall forme, indiviÅ¿ible, without extenÅ¿ion of parts. But to paÅ¿Å¿e this and to come to our preÅ¿ent purpoÅ¿e. I verily think, Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> could not made choiÅ¿e of a fitter compariÅ¿on to make good and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t his way, which he pretends to anÅ¿wer, then that Å¿ame he has pitched upon, and his own very words condemns him. He Å¿ayeth the Church is to be conÅ¿idered as an organical body. So it is indeed, and this will make for us, as we have Å¿hown before. Next where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he Å¿ayeth that it being Å¿o conÅ¿idered, <hi>the power of acting may be fundamentally and intrinÅ¿ecally in the whole, and yet each or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan move orderly in his diÅ¿tinct place and way, as in the naturall body the Å¿enÅ¿itive faculties are in all the Å¿oul originally, &amp;c.</hi> To this 1. SuppoÅ¿e it were true that the power of governing were in the whole body of the Church fundamentally or originally, yet it can not be Å¿aid that each organ formally acteth the acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For governing being an organicall act in a politicall body,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106774:147"/> thence it Å¿hould follow that all the organes were but one organ, and the body of the Church were no organicall body; But a Å¿imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar body: As, if each member in the naturall body did formally act <hi>Å¿eeing,</hi> all the members were eyes or one eye. And Å¿o, where were the body? To Å¿ay that however that each member acteth in their acts of governing, yet each acteth orderly in his diÅ¿tinct place, <hi>viz.</hi> privat ChriÅ¿tians in their place, Elders in their place and Å¿tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yet this takes not away the abÅ¿urdity: For Å¿eeing Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> will have all and every one in the body of the Church <hi>formally and authoritatively</hi> to act in the acts of Government, it followes that all and every one of them are formally Governours and Rulers, the privat ChriÅ¿tians as well as the Elders, and there is no diÅ¿tinction between them at all, as to governing, except of meer order in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting. Certainly if all and every member of the naturall body did formally elicit the act of <hi>Å¿eeing,</hi> albeit that part of the body which we now call the eye, were Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to act therein, in Å¿ome reÅ¿pect, Å¿omewhat diÅ¿tinctly, as to order, from the reÅ¿t of the parts: Yet all the reÅ¿t of the parts were as formally and properly an eye, as it. Therefore as it were madneÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿ay that in the naturall body, each member doth formally act <hi>Å¿eeing:</hi> So it is exceeding abÅ¿urd, Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing the Church to be an organicall body, and Å¿ome of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes whereof it is compoÅ¿ed, are rulers governing and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Lord, to whom Å¿ubjection and obedience in the Lord is to be given by the reÅ¿t, and are as the eyes in the naturall body; Yet to Å¿ay, that all and every member in the Church hath a formall authoritative hand or influence in the acts of governing, 2. See the incongruity of the Authors compariÅ¿on. <hi>The power</hi> (Å¿ayeth he) <hi>may be fundamentally in the whole,</hi> (viz. body, For he is Å¿peaking in the immediatly preceeding words of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall-body) <hi>and yet each organ, &amp;c. for inÅ¿tance, the Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itive faculties are in all the Å¿oul originally, &amp;c.</hi> What incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is this, to propound in the generall of power fundamentally in a whole body organicall; And then for an inÅ¿tance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Tis a very groÅ¿Å¿e abÅ¿urdity to Å¿ay that the Å¿oul is in the whole body fundamentally and radically or potentially, as we have Å¿hown before: It is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and by way of information in the whole body. 2. It is a groÅ¿Å¿e inconÅ¿equence, the Å¿enÅ¿itive faculties are in all the Å¿oul, and the Å¿oul is in the whole body: Therefore the Å¿enÅ¿itive faculties are in the whole body fundamentally. Nay, they are fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and radically in the Å¿oul, and therefore are not fundamentally and radically in the body, neither whole nor part. But are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and by way of inheÅ¿ion, in their reÅ¿pective parts or organs of the body. 3. I would fain know of the Author what he does make in the Church anÅ¿werable to the Å¿oul in the naturall body, and Å¿o that wherein the power of governing is fundamentally and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as the Å¿enÅ¿itive faculties of the naturall body are fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and radically in the Å¿oul? Is it the whole Church as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending both people and MiniÅ¿ters? That is the body. Or is it, the people? That is a part of the body.

BecauÅ¿e the Author is pleaÅ¿ed to propound the Argument from this ground, in the Å¿ofteÅ¿t way for his own advantage, we deÅ¿ire the Reader will be pleaÅ¿ed to take it thus. TheÅ¿e perÅ¿ons and theÅ¿e only in the Church have power and authority to govern, and conÅ¿equently are to exerciÅ¿e formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acts of Government, to whom in the Scripture by the Spirit of ChriÅ¿t are appropriated Å¿uch names and titles; which do import the power and authority of governing.

It cannot be called a forrain Presbytery to all the Congregations aÅ¿Å¿ociat under it; BecauÅ¿e it is made of their own Å¿everall Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hips: Nor yet can it be forrain or externall to any of them; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e every one is a part of it, and in it as a part of the whole. As a Parliament cannot be called a forrain Judicatory to the whole Kingdom whereof it is the Parliament, nor unto any of the Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Cities or Counties, which are parts of the Kingdom, and are in the Parliament by their Deputies or CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners, as parts conÅ¿tituents thereof. Indeed the Prelate and his Cathedrall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tory taking to themÅ¿elves the Government and JuriÅ¿diction over all Congregations in the DioceÅ¿e were an externall &amp; forrain Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to theÅ¿e Churches, becauÅ¿e they excluded the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and their ElderÅ¿hips from all collaterall concurrence and copartnerÅ¿hip with them in the Government. But the Presbytery we Å¿peak for, is made up of the Elders of the Å¿everall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which it governs, as intrinÅ¿ecall collaterall parts conÅ¿tituent thereof, and therefore cannot be called forrain to theÅ¿e Å¿everall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106774:157"/> Congregations. 2. When as he expreÅ¿Å¿eth the power of theÅ¿e PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries againÅ¿t which he propounds this diÅ¿pute, under the name of <hi>coercition,</hi> calling it <hi>a coercive power.</hi> He Å¿eemeth on purpoÅ¿e to choiÅ¿e an odious word, to render it Å¿uÅ¿picious by the very name: For the word of <hi>coercing,</hi> in the common uÅ¿e, moÅ¿tly Å¿eemeth to import, outward bodily or civill force exerciÅ¿ed upon perÅ¿ons or things to Å¿top and repreÅ¿Å¿e their actions, <hi>ipÅ¿is etiam renitentibus,</hi> we aÅ¿cribe no Å¿uch power unto Presbyteries: But a power of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Å¿pirituall cenÅ¿ures which have no externall force upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, yea nor PhyÅ¿icall neither, but only Morall, as adminiÅ¿tred by the ElderÅ¿hip: Tho they may be accompanied by God, With a PhyÅ¿icall (I mean a reall) operation upon the perÅ¿ons, either in mercy or judgement. And if at any time thoÅ¿e who are for PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries over more Congregations, Å¿peaking of their power, call it <hi>coercive,</hi> they mean no other thing, but a power of Spirituall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿diction exerciÅ¿ed in Spirituall cenÅ¿ures, Å¿uch as the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf and theÅ¿e of his way, attributes to particular ElderÅ¿hips of a Å¿ingle Congregation together with the Congregation over every member thereof.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>4</label> The 1. is concerning the nature of their power over the Å¿everall Congregations or Churches conÅ¿ociated in them. Our Brethren of the Independent way attribute no other power unto them but of counÅ¿el, &amp; perÅ¿waÅ¿ion to informe and hold forth unto the Churches what is commanded by the Word of God, &amp; to exhort &amp; perÅ¿wade them to their duty, to obedience of what they find commanded in the Word; But allow them no authority and juriÅ¿dictionall power to enjoine their determinations from the Word authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively under pain of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall cenÅ¿ures. So M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker,</hi> in the forecited place, <hi>pag.</hi> 2, 3. 'tis true he calls this power of counÅ¿ell, by the name of Authority.

But we Å¿hall not contend about names; Call it authority or power or what you will, the thing it Å¿elf is nothing elÅ¿e but brotherly counÅ¿ell, which hath no binding force formally as iÅ¿Å¿uing from the Presbyterie: But bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meerly <hi>vi materiae,</hi> materially in regard of the thing which is propounded by them, as it is a Scripture truth or command, as is confeÅ¿Å¿ed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker;</hi> And this is no more then one Brother may do towards another, and one Å¿iÅ¿ter Church may do to another.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">section </seg>5</label> 2. Point of ControverÅ¿ie is, that the Independent Brethren doe not allow the Å¿tanding uÅ¿e of Å¿uch aÅ¿Å¿ociated PreÅ¿byteries: But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaÅ¿ionall: We aÅ¿Å¿ert that by warrand of the Word of God Å¿ome Å¿uch PreÅ¿byteries are of Å¿tanding uÅ¿e as Å¿tanding ordinary juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Courts. We Å¿ay that ClaÅ¿Å¿icall Presbyteries, in the ordinary Å¿ettled caÅ¿e of Churches are neceÅ¿Å¿ary Å¿tanding Courts for adminiÅ¿tration of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Government, and alÅ¿o that Superiour Presbyteries, Synodicall, may be warrantably of Å¿tanding uÅ¿e where and when conveniently, moe Presbyteriall or ClaÅ¿Å¿icall Churches may have and injoy actuall combination, as of Yearly Provinciall Synods, as in the Churches of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are more frequent Provinciall Synods, and yearly Nationall AÅ¿Å¿emblies, as in the Churches of this Kingdome of Scotland.</p>
                  <p>3. Point is concerning Å¿ubordination of leÅ¿Å¿er AÅ¿Å¿emblies to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106774:158"/> greater. The Independent Brethren deny altogether Å¿ubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Inferiour AÅ¿Å¿emblies to Superiour as juridicall EccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall Courts. Albeit they acknowledge that difficulties ariÅ¿ing in a particular Congregation in matters of Government, there may be a going out to an AÅ¿Å¿embly of more Churches, and if need be, full Å¿atisfaction and clearing not being found there, there may be a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth yet to a greater and more large AÅ¿Å¿embly. Yet they Å¿ay, that is elective and only by way of reference and arbitration, and only for counÅ¿ell and direction, and aÅ¿Å¿ert, that a particular Congregation, is the Å¿upream EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Juridicall Tribunall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t upon earth. So that a perÅ¿on although wronged by an unjuÅ¿t Å¿entence there (as they are not in their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons infallible) Å¿uppoÅ¿e Å¿entenced to Excommunication (which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him off from the benefit of Church Ordinances and fellowÅ¿hip of ChriÅ¿tians in all the Churches of the World) he may have no appeal from their Å¿entence to another Superiour Judicatory to have his proceÅ¿Å¿e juridically recognoÅ¿ced, and the injurious Å¿entence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cinded, but muÅ¿t ly under it without any EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick remedy till death, unleÅ¿Å¿e that particular Congregation be pleaÅ¿ed themÅ¿elves to revoke their Å¿entence.

We aÅ¿Å¿ert alÅ¿o that, that Å¿eries and gradation of this Å¿ubordination which is acknowledged and maintained by ProteÅ¿tant Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> of Congregationall, ClaÅ¿Å¿icall, Provinciall and Nationall AÅ¿Å¿emblies is lawfull and agreeable to the Word of God.</p>

BecauÅ¿e they are without a foundation in the Word. This he undertakes to make good by clearing theÅ¿e Scriptures on which Å¿uch Presbyteries are built: And brings in four Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 15, 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 35. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. So that his firÅ¿t Argument comes to this much in full matter and forme. If Å¿uch a Presbytery over more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had any foundation in the Word it were in Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e four places: But in none of thoÅ¿e hath it foundation, therefore not at all in Scripture: But now tho his aÅ¿Å¿umption were granted, and he did clearly evidence that in none of theÅ¿e mentioned places, it hath Å¿ufficient foundation: Yet I muÅ¿t Å¿ay, he does very groÅ¿Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deÅ¿piÅ¿e his Reader (to Å¿ay the leaÅ¿t) in his major propoÅ¿ition. What, did never M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> read in Presbyteriall writers any other Scripturall grounds brought to prove Å¿uch a Presbytery but theÅ¿e 4. places, might he not at leaÅ¿t have read Å¿undry others?

We Å¿ay, at the firÅ¿t where there were more ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours then could meet in one Congregation, their PaÅ¿tours and Elders did teach and rule them in common, not being diÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively appropriated to the Å¿everall Congregations, and that yet in Å¿ome Cities where there are more Congregations, it may be Å¿o, as it is at this day in Å¿ome ProteÅ¿tant Churches: Tho we think, that now in the ordinary condition of the Church, it is convenient that Congregations be fixed, and have their Å¿everall fixed Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.

If they had acted as extraordinary perÅ¿ons, as ApoÅ¿tles, the people could not concur jointly with then in Å¿uch an act, nor could it been an Argument brought as a patern in ordinary. Now if they acted not by their extraordinary office and power in ordaining Elders, what reaÅ¿on is there to Å¿ay, that in the ordination of theÅ¿e Deacons, they acted in that way? 2.

AnÅ¿w.</hi> FirÅ¿t here ere I come to the main buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, note Å¿hortly Å¿ome few things. 1. We never attributed authority to a forrain ElderÅ¿hip, over any perÅ¿ons or Churches. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> here Å¿aying that a forrain ElderÅ¿hip hath peculiar authority (if his meaning be according to his words<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> if he underÅ¿tand authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) that is an ElderÅ¿hip extrinÅ¿ecall to Churches, yet hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar authority over them, goeth farther then ever PreÅ¿byterians did, and indeed goeth clearly contrary to truth, and in terms, Å¿peaketh very like the Prelatick way, which attributed to a forrain ElderÅ¿hip, the Prelate and his Cathedrall, authority over all the Churches in the DiocaeÅ¿e. But indeed his words and his Å¿enÅ¿e agree not: For his peculiar authority, is no authority, as we Å¿hall Å¿ee anone. 2. We Å¿ay yet it is but an odious feigned deÅ¿cription of that power of juriÅ¿diction, we attribute to Synods and other aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ociated Presbyteries, when it is called <hi>a power to conÅ¿train their reÅ¿ults to be practiÅ¿ed,</hi> as we have diÅ¿covered it before. 3. It is yet a groÅ¿Å¿er miÅ¿repreÅ¿entation, that we attribute unto Å¿uch Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries a power to <hi>cenÅ¿ure perÅ¿ons EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tically in caÅ¿e they have the reÅ¿ult of things produced by them and do not follow them.</hi> Did ever any Persbyterian Å¿ay Å¿uch a thing as this, that a Synod or Presbytery has power to cenÅ¿ure perÅ¿ons who have their reÅ¿ults by them and does not follow them. For example, that a Synod in <hi>Scotland</hi> hath power to cenÅ¿ure perÅ¿ons, in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> that have their reÅ¿ults by them and does not follow them, or that any Presbytery hath power to cenÅ¿ure perÅ¿ons of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of their aÅ¿Å¿ociation, who, may be, have their reÅ¿ult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

CounÅ¿ell or advice is but an act of charity, and (if good) of wiÅ¿dom and prudence, and not of authority. 'Tis no other act but that which one man may do to a Church, one brother to another, one woman to another, yea as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> a maid to <hi>Naaman.</hi> That the Author Å¿aith it is a power of preheminent and prevailing counÅ¿ell, that it ought to prevail more upon our hearts than the interpretation of Å¿ingle perÅ¿ons and ordinary helps, availeth not: For preheminent counÅ¿ell is Å¿till but counÅ¿ell, and Å¿o that which is attributed to the Synod differeth no wayes from that which is competent to any Å¿ingle perÅ¿ons to do, or one Å¿iÅ¿ter and equall Church to another, but only gradually. And Å¿uppoÅ¿e a company of ChriÅ¿tians, PaÅ¿tors or others met together, not Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, being perÅ¿ons of known piety and underÅ¿tanding in maters of Religion, their counÅ¿ell would be Å¿uch a preheminent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing counÅ¿ell, that it ought to be preferred and prevail more with our hearts then the interpretation of Å¿ingle perÅ¿ons. So here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there is no peculiar authority, or power granted to that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, as Å¿uch an Ordinance of God. If yet it Å¿hall be Å¿aid that their counÅ¿ell is preheminent and prevailing, ought to prevail more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only upon this ground, that they are many, pious and underÅ¿tanding men, and liker to find out the minde of God in his Word then Å¿ingle perÅ¿ons: But alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e they are Å¿uch an inÅ¿titute meeting, a Synod. To this, I cannot Å¿ee how Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> can Å¿ay this, having but now told us that the decrees of the Synod bind materially, as being the will of God, but not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the reÅ¿ult of the Presbytery.

If there be a preheminency or
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106774:166"/> power of prevailing in the decree of a Synod, Å¿o that there is an obligation upon our hearts to be more prevailed with, over and above that preheminency and power of prevailing which is in the counÅ¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For if it Å¿hall be Å¿aid it is not juridicall power, but only dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or doctrinall, then I Å¿ay this is competent to every Å¿ingle Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tor; For a truth of the GoÅ¿pel taught and delivered by a Å¿ingle PaÅ¿tor, ought to be beleeved and obeyed, <hi>i. e.</hi> bindeth to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and faith, not only becauÅ¿e it is GoÅ¿pel, but becauÅ¿e it is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally taught by a MiniÅ¿ter, and Å¿o that preheminent and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power Å¿hall differ from the power of a Å¿ingle PaÅ¿tor, but only gradually, and is the very Å¿ame in kinde, and Å¿o no peculiar autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or power of a Synod, as Å¿uch an Ordinance of God.

                  <p>1. Is made up of two proceÅ¿Å¿es, the firÅ¿t whereof is this. <hi>TheÅ¿e decrees are Å¿aid to bind theÅ¿e to whom they are Å¿ent: But they were Å¿ent to all the Churches of the Gentiles.</hi> This is evident Å¿aith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier, Acts</hi> 21. 25. <hi>as touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written and concluded that they obÅ¿erve,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo, <hi>they did bind all the Churches of the Gentiles. AnÅ¿w.</hi> To this 1. for the Major, where is it Å¿o Å¿aid? I cannot remember any place of the Å¿tory where this is Å¿aid. If he and <hi>Hooker,</hi> from whom he hath this, mean, that we Å¿ay and confeÅ¿Å¿e this, that the decrees of the Synod bind all theÅ¿e to whom they are Å¿ent, that we never Å¿aid; If it be underÅ¿tood of binding as Synodicall decrees. A Synod in one Nation may Å¿end their decrees unto Churches of another Nation (as was ordinary to do in the Primitive times) yet we Å¿ay not, that the decrees of a Synod of one Nation, binds the Churches in another Nation, though, may be, the mater of them binds them. 2. For the minor: If the meaning be, (as it muÅ¿t be, that the Argument may Å¿peak to the purpoÅ¿e it is intended for) that they were Å¿ent by way of Synodicall decrees to all the Churches of the Gentiles (as certainly they were to Å¿ome) we deny it, the place cited, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 25. proves it not: For it Å¿peaks of the Gentiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitly, and clearly relates, to the Letter written, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. where the very inÅ¿cription bears, that Å¿o they were Å¿ent only to the Gentiles in <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia v.</hi> 23. 'Tis true <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> delivered the decrees to others as they went through the cities, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. but it is not Å¿aid that they were Å¿ent to them by way of Synodicall decrees, as they were to theÅ¿e other Churches. But grant that one way or other they were Å¿ent alÅ¿o to the reÅ¿t of the Churches of the Gentiles, that is, that it was the will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Synod, that as occaÅ¿ion Å¿hould Å¿erve they Å¿hould be delivered to them, and we Å¿hall alÅ¿o grant the concluÅ¿ion of this firÅ¿t proceÅ¿Å¿e in Å¿ome Å¿enÅ¿e, that they did bind all the Churches of the Gentiles. See we what Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> will infer upon this in his next proceÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

                     <hi>Now theÅ¿e</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>(i.) all the Churches of the Gentiles had no CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners delegated to that Synod: Therefore what the Synod did could not bind them by way of authoritative juriÅ¿di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauÅ¿e where is no delegation of CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners there is no</hi>

If he mean only that Å¿ome of them had no CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners there, it is true, and we grant that the decrees of the Synod did not bind theÅ¿e Churches by way of juriÅ¿diction and formally as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Synod, but materially. But hence it followeth not that they did not bind at all, nor any, by way of juriÅ¿diction. For Å¿ome Gentile Churches had their CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners there, and were Members of the Synod, <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> (theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t, if they had not, yet they might and ought to have had, and it is moÅ¿t probable they had) and Å¿o theÅ¿e Churches might be bound by them by way of juriÅ¿diction and formally, for ought that is brought in this Argument, and they did Å¿o bind them as is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proven in the Authors cited before.</p>

I will not Å¿tay to exaggerate this to the full, who Å¿ees not the groÅ¿Å¿e peccancy of this: And if the Author would have concluded formally and right upon his premiÅ¿es, the concluÅ¿ion Å¿hould have been this: Therefore the decrees of this Synod did bind more Churches then Å¿uch as it did bind by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall juriÅ¿diction.

                     </gap> day, as it is indeed in Å¿ome Reformed Churches without repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to any poÅ¿itive Divine inÅ¿titution. But, 2. granting that the Scriptures doe teÅ¿tifie, that the ordinary Ruling power of Elders is not extendended beyond their ordinary power of Teaching (for that which Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> addeth that the Scripture holdeth forth that rather the Teaching power exceeds in extent his Ruling po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, we deÅ¿ire proof of it, for he brings none) we Å¿ay that it is a miÅ¿take which is alledged, that the Presbytery we Å¿peak for, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over more Congregations extends the ordinary Ruling power of PaÅ¿tours beyond the extent of their ordinary Teaching power: It does only extend the ordinary exerciÅ¿e or <hi>actus Å¿ecundos</hi> of the one, beyond the ordinary exerciÅ¿e or <hi>actus Å¿ecundos</hi> of the other, having herein a call to the one and not to the other, which is no incongruity, nor doth oppoÅ¿e any part of the Word of God.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:106774:177"/> are matters of externall order and policy, which are determinable by the true light of nature, right reaÅ¿on, and generall Rules in the Scripture, about which is exerted that power which is called Diatactick; there are alÅ¿o tryalls and ordinations of MiniÅ¿ters. Now I do not think that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lockier</hi> will take it upon him, to averre, that the Elders of a Å¿ingle Congregation are like in reaÅ¿on to be more learned, and Å¿o more advantaged to judge in matters of this kind, then all the able choiÅ¿e men, MiniÅ¿ters, and Elders from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations aÅ¿Å¿embled together in a Synod, or in a ClaÅ¿Å¿icall Presbytery. 2. He inÅ¿inuateth alÅ¿o this Å¿uppoÅ¿ition, that in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ineÅ¿Å¿es of DiÅ¿cipline about particular perÅ¿ons there is no other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be cognoÅ¿ced and determined, but QueÅ¿tions of <hi>meer fact;</hi> For, he Å¿peaks of Å¿uch matters as are known and diÅ¿cerned by Å¿enÅ¿e, and whereof men are eye-witneÅ¿Å¿es. This is another miÅ¿take. For often times in Å¿uch buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es are involved intricat QueÅ¿tions of Law or <hi>(Juris)</hi> as frequent experiences in the exerciÅ¿es and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿es of DiÅ¿cipline, prove daily. As, Å¿uppoÅ¿e the phyÅ¿icall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or doing of an act alledged upon a perÅ¿on, as Å¿candall, be found proven, for example, that he has eaten Swines fleÅ¿h before a weak beleeving Jew: Yet there may be this QueÅ¿tion of Law whether Å¿uch an act Å¿o circumÅ¿tantiat, be under the kind of a Å¿candall: Upon reÅ¿olution of which doth depend the convicting of a perÅ¿on guilty of a Å¿candalous fact. And again, Å¿uppoÅ¿e a perÅ¿on be found unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tionably guilty of a Å¿candalous fact, yet there may be QueÅ¿tion of the demerit and weight of it in relation to cenÅ¿ure: Now altho it be true, that the Presbytery of a particular Congregation is like to be more Learned, as to matters of meer fact in buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members; Yet it can hardly be Å¿aid in reaÅ¿on, that 'tis like they will be more learned in QueÅ¿tions of Law involved therein, then many choiÅ¿e able men from many Congregations. 3.

I adde but this, Å¿uppoÅ¿e the ElderÅ¿hip of a Congregation may be more learned in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es of their members, yet I Å¿uppoÅ¿e (that which is not unuÅ¿uall to fall out) there may be differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Elders, or between the Elders and the people (who, according to Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> may have as much hand and more, in the juriÅ¿diction, as the Elders) or both may be divided in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that nothing can be concluded amongÅ¿t them: What will you have done in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e?

His Argument fully Å¿et up is this: If every particular Congregation rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tituted and compleated hath Å¿ufficiencie within it Å¿elf to exerciÅ¿e all the Ordinances of ChriÅ¿t, to Ordaine, to Excommunicate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

AnÅ¿w.</hi> Ere I reply particularly, firÅ¿t we would underÅ¿tand, what the Author doeth underÅ¿tand by the compleatneÅ¿Å¿e of a particular Congregation, and what may be underÅ¿tood, by having Å¿ufficiency within it Å¿elf to exerciÅ¿e all the Ordinances of ChriÅ¿t: for the former, I conceive the Author meaneth a particular Congregation to be compleat in its conÅ¿titution, when as beÅ¿ide, the body of private ProÅ¿eÅ¿Å¿ours, there is in it an ElderÅ¿hip made up of all the integrall parts thereof, PaÅ¿tours, or one PaÅ¿tour, Teachers, or one Teacher at leaÅ¿t. and Å¿ome competent number of Ruling Elders, three at leaÅ¿t, Å¿o many Officers, according to our Brethren, make up a compleat Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip for a Congregation. For the other we would conÅ¿ider, that by Å¿ufficiencie to exerciÅ¿e the Ordinances of ChriÅ¿t, we muÅ¿t under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand not only a competencie of gifts and abilities of wiÅ¿edome and underÅ¿tanding for exerciÅ¿ing Å¿uch and Å¿uch acts; But alÅ¿o, power and authority by a divine warrand, inÅ¿titution and call. A private gifted man may have the competencie of gifts for Preaching the GoÅ¿pel, AdminiÅ¿tration of Sacraments, yet he hath not Å¿imply Å¿ufficiencie to exerciÅ¿e that Ordinance, becauÅ¿e he hath not power and authority by calling from God to do it: TheÅ¿e premiÅ¿ed, for <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> 1. The major PropoÅ¿ition is a groÅ¿Å¿e <hi>non-Å¿equitur,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the wiÅ¿dom of God in his Ordinances: for there may be for a certain end a mean appointed of God, which is by it Å¿elf Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for effecting that end Å¿imply, and another mean appointed of God for that Å¿ame end, and yet this is not uÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e becauÅ¿e the other is Å¿ufficient; BecauÅ¿e this may be for the better, more eaÅ¿ie, more Å¿afe effecting of it. Manifold inÅ¿tances might be given of this, the promiÅ¿e of Å¿alvation or of the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of Believers, is of and by it Å¿elf Å¿ufficient enough to give aÅ¿Å¿urance to the Children of God of the immutability of Gods counÅ¿ell and purpoÅ¿e of their Å¿alvation: Was therefore the oath added to the word of promiÅ¿e uÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e. God forbid it Å¿hould be Å¿aid, it is added of Å¿uperabundant good will that we might have the more aboundant aÅ¿Å¿urance and conÅ¿olation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18.

If he AnÅ¿wer yes, as it is moÅ¿t abÅ¿urd and contrary to the Scriptures of God to make a Church exerciÅ¿ing the publike Ordinances of ChriÅ¿t without the Officers and MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t: So, if Å¿o, what needed him propound the Argument of a Congregation compleat? If he AnÅ¿wer no; May not a ClaÅ¿Å¿icall Presbytery be of uÅ¿e here? ElÅ¿e how Å¿hall their ordinances be exerciÅ¿ed to them?

But 2. Its a groÅ¿Å¿e <hi>non-Å¿equitur,</hi> a particular Church, or the PaÅ¿tors in a particular Church, have Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency or power to preach the GoÅ¿pel, and adminiÅ¿ter Sacraments, without the help or concurrence of the ClaÅ¿Å¿icall Presbyterie. <hi>Ergo</hi> they may alÅ¿o exerciÅ¿e theÅ¿e other Ordinances, Ordination and Excommunication, without their concurrence; And the proof of it is invalide, becauÅ¿e that is greater, and if they may do the greater alone by themÅ¿elves, they may alÅ¿o do the leÅ¿Å¿er: For by that Å¿ame reaÅ¿on it Å¿hould follow, A PaÅ¿tor hath Å¿ufficiency and power by himÅ¿elf alone to preach the GoÅ¿pel, to Baptize without the help and concurrence of his fellow-Elders in the Congregation.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:106774:182"/> 
                     <hi>Ergo</hi> he may alÅ¿o by himÅ¿elf alone Ordain and Excommunicate, without their help and concurrence. Why? That is the greater<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and if he may do the greater alone, he may alÅ¿o do the leÅ¿Å¿er. The Author himÅ¿elf will not, I conceive, admit the ConÅ¿equence here. The truth is, the intereÅ¿t of perÅ¿ons to exerciÅ¿e this, or that, or the other, Ordinance is not to be attended or determined, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greater or leÅ¿Å¿er excellency of the work: But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ChriÅ¿ts commiÅ¿Å¿ion, inÅ¿titution, and grant of power to them. The exerciÅ¿e of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall power in Å¿ome things, (which is commonly called <hi>power of order</hi>) as Preaching of the Word, AdminiÅ¿tration of Sacraments, is given to ChriÅ¿ts MiniÅ¿ters, Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and a part, conÅ¿idered as Å¿ingle PaÅ¿tors. So a PaÅ¿tor may preach the Word and adminiÅ¿ter Sacraments alone, without concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or Å¿peciall conÅ¿ent, either of the whole Church, or other Rulers to every act: But in other things (theÅ¿e of the power, called the <hi>power of juriÅ¿diction</hi>) the exerciÅ¿e and power thereof is not given to one, but to an <hi>unity:</hi> To the community of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church united together: not any Å¿ingle Rulers Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally. Therefore tho a PaÅ¿tor may preach, and baptize alone, yet he may not CenÅ¿ure nor Excommunicate alone; And if he Å¿hould do this, the act were invalide, both in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> and in <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tico.</hi> Now the power of Ordination and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation being given to a community, the QueÅ¿tion is, whether this community be a particular Congregation, having an intire par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ElderÅ¿hip, or the ElderÅ¿hip of a particular Congregation, by it Å¿elf and independent from a larger Presbyterie, this Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿aith, but his Argument, grounded upon our grant, to prove it, is impertinent, as we have Å¿een.</p>

Now we adde but theÅ¿e things here. 1. I would ask Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> what he means by <hi>the Church of Believers in the GoÅ¿pel?</hi> Whether the univerÅ¿all Church ViÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Believers? Then he muÅ¿t acknowledge a Church UniverÅ¿all ViÅ¿ible individually one: For certainly the article <hi>(the)</hi> denota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a certain Å¿ingular one thing. But this, I doubt, Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> will grant, A ViÅ¿ible Church Catholick, exiÅ¿ting really one. And however: it is not his purpoÅ¿e here, to alledge that <hi>Peter</hi> received the Keyes, as perÅ¿onating the UniverÅ¿all Church ViÅ¿ible. For the thing he would be at and muÅ¿t prove, is, that all the Keyes and exerciÅ¿e thereof are given to every one particular Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, Å¿ingly and within it Å¿elf. If he Å¿ay he means a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ViÅ¿ible Church, I ask which is it, of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Corinth,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿us?</hi> If any one of theÅ¿e definitely, what then becommeth of all the reÅ¿t? Nay but will he Å¿ay, not any one particular ViÅ¿ible Church definitely, but indefinitely any and every one. But 1. His words are, that <hi>Peter</hi> in this mater perÅ¿onated <hi>the</hi> Church ViÅ¿ible, which in propriety of Å¿peech, Å¿eemeth to me to note a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate and definite individuall, but paÅ¿Å¿ing this. 2. It cannot be a particular ViÅ¿ible Church, whether definitely, or Å¿ome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one: or indefinitely for any one; BecauÅ¿e, as Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> himÅ¿elf Å¿ayeth, the Church that <hi>Peter</hi> perÅ¿onated is that which ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>that he would build upon the rock, that the gates of hell Å¿hould not prevail againÅ¿t it.</hi> But this is not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ViÅ¿ible Church, but either the Church InviÅ¿ible of the elect and redeemed ones, or the Church ViÅ¿ible Catholick; BecauÅ¿e any particular ViÅ¿ible Church may be prevailed againÅ¿t. 3. That AÅ¿Å¿ertion, <hi>Surely this particular here uÅ¿ed</hi> (to wit, the Pronoun of the Å¿econd perÅ¿on twiÅ¿e in the Å¿entence, <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou) is not in vain,</hi>

In extraordinary caÅ¿es, to do things unordinary, I mean as to the courÅ¿e appointed by a poÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive law, may be with very good Å¿atisfaction to a moÅ¿t tender heart, that is, a well informed and rightly tender heart, and not a Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titious heart: <hi>Have ye not read</hi> (Å¿aith our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 4,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:106774:185"/> 5.) <hi>what David did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him, how he entred into the houÅ¿e of God, and did eat the Å¿hew-bread, which was not lawfull for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the PrieÅ¿ts?</hi> It was an unordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing for <hi>David,</hi> or any other men, not PrieÅ¿ts, to eat the Shew-bread: Yet in that extraordinary caÅ¿e, when <hi>David</hi> and his company were hungry, and no other bread was to be had, let their hearts be never Å¿o tender, if rightly informed, as they did eat, Å¿o with good Å¿atisfaction they might eat it.

The nature and conÅ¿titution of Gods Ordinances is not eÅ¿timat and defined according to what Å¿hape, the hearts of men are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he has put upon them: but according to what his own word Å¿aith of his will concerning them. It was yeelding to this aptitude of mens hearts in conceiving Gods Å¿haping of Ordinances, that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing by private perÅ¿ons, and even midwives, did Å¿pring from, into the Church of God. 3. The ordinary and expreÅ¿Å¿e rule that we Å¿peak of, that Å¿ingle Congregations Å¿hould not exerciÅ¿e acts of juriÅ¿diction of publick and common concernment, by themÅ¿elves alone without aÅ¿Å¿ociat ElderÅ¿hips, relates to the caÅ¿e when aÅ¿Å¿oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation may be had. But when aÅ¿Å¿ociation cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly be had, as if a Congregation be in a remote Iland, or divided from all other Churches by Å¿ome other inÅ¿uperable impediment of fellowÅ¿hip, we Å¿ay that in that caÅ¿e of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, it is the ordinary rule to that Congregation to act as it is, alone by it Å¿elf: If it Å¿hall be Å¿aid, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when it is that way alone, it may exerciÅ¿e theÅ¿e Ordinances within it Å¿elf, then if, other Congregations being in a capacitie to be joined with, it may not exerciÅ¿e them alone, it is abridged off the former liberty it had before when it was alone by it Å¿elf. I anÅ¿w this is no abridgement of its liberty, but only a Å¿trengthening of their power in things of common concernment; As, Å¿uppoÅ¿e there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five Elders in a Congregation, while as they are only theÅ¿e five, they may act in the Government of that Congregation. Yet if other fix be added to them, they may not now act without theÅ¿e, yet this is no abridging of any liberty they had, but a Å¿trengthening
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:106774:186"/> of their power. The truth is, that a Congregation in an incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of aÅ¿Å¿ociation with other Congregations, exerciÅ¿eth and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿eth all theÅ¿e Ordinances within it Å¿elf, not as being one Å¿ingle Congregation, but as being the whole Church. A Congregation in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e, is as if there were not another Congregation in the world, and that is to be the whole Church <hi>interpretativÃ¨.</hi> JuÅ¿t as there being in a Congregation five Elders only, theÅ¿e five act all things belonging to Elders in the Congregation, not becauÅ¿e they are Å¿uch a definite competent number, but becauÅ¿e they are the whole number; BecauÅ¿e if they did act as being Å¿uch a definite number, they could not admit any moe to joyne with them in the work.</p>

Lord grant him mercy of it. 'Tis none of our pleading for the Presbyterian way, that many godly being in it, therefore Å¿imply purging of Presbyterian Churches, were more proper then rooting up and pulling down all. If any man, Sir, has come to reaÅ¿on with you, thus poorly for Presbyterian Churches, we doubt not but ere that time he has dealt treacherouÅ¿ly againÅ¿t the truth. We tell you, the Presbyterian way, is Gods way inÅ¿tituted in his Word, the contrary whereof you, but beggingly Å¿uppoÅ¿e in framing your Objection, but has not, nor ever will prove. Yet this we affirme, that albeit there be in Churches, corruptions, not only in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ations of many perÅ¿ons, but alÅ¿o in Å¿ome things in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip and Ordinances, yet if they be not Å¿uch corruptions as everts and deÅ¿troyes the foundation and Å¿ubÅ¿tance of Religion: But there

And as to that Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> alledgeth, that Presbyterians would have down EpiÅ¿copall Churches: Either he has not underÅ¿tood or miÅ¿repreÅ¿ented Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians mind in that matter: Indeed Presbyterians were zealous to have the corrupt office of Prelacy plucked up, root and branch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e a plant that God had never planted in his Church, and could not hear of a purging or circumciÅ¿ing of it, that Å¿ome would been at, by clipping from them officialls and Å¿uch other appendicles and limiting them thus and thus. But that the whole frame of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that were under Prelaticall government Å¿hould be razed down to the ground, pluckt up root and branch, caÅ¿t all in a heap of ruine, that out of the ruines thereof, their Å¿hould been picked out here and there Å¿ome Å¿tones, to build up new Churches, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entered in the thoughts of Å¿ome Presbyterians.

If Å¿peaking Å¿o broadly, he mean of Presbyterian Churches through the World (as indeed your diÅ¿courÅ¿e here for pulling them down and Å¿eparating from them, runneth generally without any exception or limitation) that for their matter, three parts of four are naught, prophane atheiÅ¿ts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What bold, and blind conjecturing is this? 2. If ye mean only the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that therein three parts of four are naught, prophane, atheiÅ¿ts, both Elders and people: Yet I Å¿ay, <hi>who art thou that judgeth another mans Å¿ervant?</hi> No doubt many amongÅ¿t us are nothing Å¿uch as they ought to be, and it has been alwayes Å¿o for the moÅ¿t part, in Churches from the beginning: But that they are Å¿o many and Å¿o groÅ¿Å¿e, prophane, atheiÅ¿ts, both people and Elders, for a man that is a Å¿tranger to the moÅ¿t part of our Churches, Elders and people thereof, to pronounce Å¿o peremptorly, is more then he dare anÅ¿wer to God or his own conÅ¿cience upon Å¿econd conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat thoughts. 3. SuppoÅ¿e it were Å¿o indeed, that three of four in Churches, were naught, yet, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing in Churches, there be the true Doctrine of the GoÅ¿pel Preached, the Sacraments, for their Å¿ubÅ¿tance and eÅ¿Å¿entialls agreeable to their inÅ¿titution, the acts of worÅ¿hip for matter pure, muÅ¿t therefore, Gods people Å¿eparat from thoÅ¿e Churches, and the true Ordinances and WorÅ¿hip of God therein: Or muÅ¿t the Churches be pulled down, and plucked up root and branch? Shew us warrand either of precept or practice for this in the whole Word of God. Nay the Å¿train of Prophets, ApoÅ¿tles, and ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf are clearly, as the Sun-Å¿hine, againÅ¿t it. How often was it Å¿o with the ancient Church, that we may
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:106774:191"/> Å¿ay, more then three parts of four were prophane and naught? And yet did not the Godly and the Prophets of the Lord continue in the exerciÅ¿e of the Ordinances and WorÅ¿hip of God in that Church? Was it not Å¿o in the Church of the Jews, in the time of ChriÅ¿t being amongÅ¿t them upon earth? Did ever ChriÅ¿t for that require his DiÅ¿ciples to depart and Å¿eparat from that Church? Or did he not himÅ¿elf, never a white the leÅ¿Å¿e, continue in the Church communion thereof? Yea when in glory writing a Letter to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> of whom he teÅ¿tifies, that they had a name that they were living, but yet were dead, and that there were but a few names there which had not defiled their garments: Yet his wiÅ¿e and meek zeal is not for pulling down and rooting up and Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the Church Communion in his Ordinances and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip. But that is his direction, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Be watchfull and Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the things which remain and are ready to die.âRemember therefore how thou haÅ¿t received and heard, and hold faÅ¿t and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> 4. But Å¿uppoÅ¿e that <hi>de facto,</hi> in Å¿ome Churches the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of perÅ¿ons Elders and people were Å¿o groÅ¿Å¿e and abominably prophane, that there were no living for godly ones amongÅ¿t them, is this a good Argument to prove that the very Å¿pecies and kinde muÅ¿t be deÅ¿troyed and plucked up root and branch? UnleÅ¿Å¿e that Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> could Å¿hew that the way of Presbyterian Churches of it Å¿elf, in its very kind, allowes Churches to be conÅ¿titute Å¿o, of perÅ¿ons notoriouÅ¿ly prophane, and atheiÅ¿ts, that will not follow: But if he Å¿hall Å¿ay this, we will avow it to be a Å¿lander. 5. When as he will have our Churches to be deÅ¿titute of a right forme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they are not united by way of their Church-Covenant, but are knit together only by Å¿ituation, and by forrain forenÅ¿icall El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿hips: And upon this account, will have them no Churches, but only carcaÅ¿Å¿es of Churches. It is utterly falÅ¿e that we make Å¿ituation or cohabitation in place or a forrain ElderÅ¿hip the form of our Churches. We Å¿ay according to the Word of God, that the form which gives the being to the UniverÅ¿all Church ViÅ¿ible, and unto every member thereof, is the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of, and entering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that generall Covenant with God in his Son JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and whereby every ChriÅ¿tian is oblidged and engaged to walk in all the wayes of God and perform all duties towards God, and other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:106774:192"/> in all their relations, required of them, according as God giveth opportunity and occaÅ¿ion to perform and exerciÅ¿e them. As for Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> Church-Covenant, diÅ¿tinct from that generall Covenant with God in ChriÅ¿t, as the form of a particular Church giving it the being of a Church, and right to the Ordinances of ChriÅ¿t, 'tis nothing elÅ¿e but a new device of men, having no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of precept or example in the Word of God either of the Old or New TeÅ¿tament: And his un-Churching of our Churches for want of Å¿uch a Covenant as this, is like many other things in this peece, has more boldneÅ¿Å¿e in it then underÅ¿tanding or reaÅ¿on.

To his Å¿econd exception. 'Tis true, in practicall things it is not Å¿o much a mans word as his practiÅ¿e which gives the diÅ¿like. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion is whether, the performance of a lawfull and neceÅ¿Å¿ary duty of worÅ¿hip, or exerciÅ¿e of a true Ordinance of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, partaking of the Lords Supper to remember his death till he come againe, when and where wicked and Å¿candalous perÅ¿ons will thruÅ¿t themÅ¿elves in to do it prophanely, or are permitted by Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Å¿o to do, be Å¿uch a practicall thing as I am oblidged to diÅ¿like, as a thing unlawfull for me to do, this is the QueÅ¿tion, the negative whereof we hold to be the truth of God held forth in his Word. The inÅ¿tance produced by the Author for clearing this his Å¿econd exception, <hi>viz.</hi> of a man in an Idolatrous Church proteÅ¿ting againÅ¿t the MaÅ¿Å¿e, and yet Å¿till going to MaÅ¿Å¿e, is Å¿o groÅ¿Å¿ely and abÅ¿urd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent, that one may wonder how it could be alledged, in this purpoÅ¿e, by an intelligent man. The MaÅ¿Å¿e is even upon the mater one of the groÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿t Idolatries that ever was in the world. And for a man to go to MaÅ¿Å¿e, when he pretends to proteÅ¿t to go againÅ¿t it, is to adde, to commiÅ¿Å¿ion of Idolatry, mocking of God and Å¿inning againÅ¿t light profeÅ¿Å¿edly. So that Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> needed not make it a mater of doubting how well Å¿uch a practiÅ¿e Å¿hould pleaÅ¿e God, or deliver the man from guiltineÅ¿Å¿e. But what is this, to participating of a true Ordinance of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t (for inÅ¿tance, the communion of the Lords Table) in a Church not Idolatrous, but may be, negligent and looÅ¿e in the exerciÅ¿e of DiÅ¿cipline, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting wicked Å¿candalous perÅ¿ons to participate in that Ordinance, when the Godly participating with them, teÅ¿tifies againÅ¿t Å¿uch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buÅ¿e in the Ordinances? Nay, can it be freed, from great raÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, (I will not Å¿ay that which I might) to parallel theÅ¿e two together? But yet farther to bring in as a parallel to clear the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>Naamans</hi> practiÅ¿ing of heathniÅ¿h Idolatry in the houÅ¿e of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> amongÅ¿t a people not Å¿o much as profeÅ¿Å¿ing the true
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:106774:194"/> God, but an HeathniÅ¿h people profeÅ¿Å¿edly, denying the God of IÅ¿rael, what will intelligent pious men Å¿ay to this? To the third exception. Whether Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> defines proteÅ¿ting well, to be a peece of revenge, the vehemencie of Repentance, let Lawyers judge. To my Å¿imple apprehenÅ¿ion, proteÅ¿ting, in the nature of it, has nothing to do with Repentance, as not importing guiltineÅ¿Å¿e in the perÅ¿on proteÅ¿ting, but being an act whereby he teÅ¿tifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Å¿infulneÅ¿Å¿e and unjuÅ¿tice of the dead of Å¿ome others, that he himÅ¿elf may appear clear and free from the concurrence in or the acceÅ¿Å¿ion to it, and preÅ¿erves himÅ¿elf in a legall capacitie to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it before a judge competent, but whereas Mr. <hi>Lockier</hi> Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿eth that a man proteÅ¿ting or teÅ¿tifying againÅ¿t the intruÅ¿ion or admiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿candalous wicked perÅ¿ons, into the participation of an Ordinance of ChriÅ¿t or lawfull neceÅ¿Å¿arie act of WorÅ¿hip, if he participate in that Ordinance or WorÅ¿hip, when and where Å¿can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perÅ¿ons participates therein, that in this the man halts and halves, he does but beg the thing which will not be granted to him, and he will never prove. And on begged Å¿uppoÅ¿itions to Å¿ay, <hi>how theÅ¿e will accord, is worthy deep thoughts of heart,</hi> favours of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Readers, if not of Å¿omewhat elÅ¿e. To the fourth, when there is a ProteÅ¿tation againÅ¿t the conÅ¿titution and very being of an AÅ¿Å¿embly, 'tis true there is no Å¿ubmitting to it by the ProteÅ¿ters: But yet there may be a proteÅ¿ting againÅ¿t Å¿ome on or more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deeds of an AÅ¿Å¿embly when the conÅ¿titution and being of it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and to Å¿uch an AÅ¿Å¿embly Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion is not refuÅ¿ed or denyed by any principles of ours: So there may be a proteÅ¿ting or teÅ¿tifying againÅ¿t Å¿ome particular abuÅ¿es in a Church, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion keeped with that Church in lawfull, true, neceÅ¿Å¿arie acts of Divine WorÅ¿hip. But if the Author mean, that if Å¿uch an abuÅ¿e be in a Church, as that wicked perÅ¿ons are permitted in it, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Communion, that in that caÅ¿e, the Godly muÅ¿t proteÅ¿t not only againÅ¿t the deed, but the very thing of that Church, as no Church, and therefore muÅ¿t not joine therewith, in warranted acts of WorÅ¿hip, but Å¿eparate from its Communion altogether, he will not have the Å¿imile of AÅ¿Å¿emblies and our cariage to them, to go along with him, and it is in it Å¿elf without warrand contrare to the warrand of Scripture, and we doubt not to Å¿ay a moÅ¿t SchiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick AÅ¿Å¿ertion.</p>

We Å¿ay it is the initiall Å¿eal and Å¿olemne entry and admiÅ¿Å¿ion of Members into the ViÅ¿ible Church, Å¿o this, is a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s Objection brought in, it would Å¿eeme to vent a new conceit borrowed out of Mr. <hi>Hookers Survey, part</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. of a Church without BaptiÅ¿me, of which a word Å¿hortly upon his AnÅ¿wer to this Objection: Only here we Å¿ay this, that which gives form and being to a Church is the true Doctrine of the GoÅ¿pel and Covenant of Grace, for Å¿ubÅ¿tantials at leaÅ¿t, Å¿olemnly avowed by the Å¿ealing of BaptiÅ¿m, and Preached by a lawfull MiniÅ¿try (<hi>Lawfull</hi> MiniÅ¿try. I Å¿ay, as to the eÅ¿Å¿entials of a GoÅ¿pel-MiniÅ¿try) theÅ¿e three at leaÅ¿t are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to give the being of a GoÅ¿pel-Church. And where theÅ¿e are, tho there be many corruptions and defects in the Church, yet it is capable to purge it Å¿elf from its corruptions, and to Å¿upply its defects, and to urge unchurching of Å¿uch a Å¿ociety, and diÅ¿Å¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, as no Church, or totall Å¿eparation from it, is not of GOD.</p>
                  <p>But come we to Å¿peak a little to the Authors AnÅ¿wer to his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: <hi>BaptiÅ¿m</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>doth not give the form of Church memberÅ¿hip.</hi> So Å¿ay we too: ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of the true ChriÅ¿tian faith is that which giveth the form of Church-memberÅ¿hip <hi>de jure,</hi> BaptiÅ¿m is the Å¿olemn Å¿eal thereof. But Mr. <hi>Lock.</hi> having in his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection Å¿poken of that which giveth form &amp; being to a Church, how falleth he now to Å¿peak of that which giveth form of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berÅ¿hip? Is there no more requiÅ¿ite to give form and being to a Church (we are now Å¿peaking of a Church ViÅ¿ible) but that which giveth form to Church memberÅ¿hip Å¿imply? This is a groÅ¿Å¿e miÅ¿take. ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion of the ChriÅ¿tian Faith, <hi>Å¿impliciter,</hi> is that which adaequately gives the form and being to Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip Å¿imply. But to give form and being to a Church, there muÅ¿t be concurring with this, a MiniÅ¿teriall diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of the Doctrine
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:106774:195"/> of Faith and Ordinances, by Å¿uch means as ChriÅ¿t hath inÅ¿tituted them to be diÅ¿penÅ¿ed by.

While as he averres that there may be a Church (he muÅ¿t mean a ChriÅ¿tian Church elÅ¿e he Å¿peaks not to purpoÅ¿e) before baptiÅ¿m, and that even before they be baptized, acting eminent Church acts, as making to themÅ¿elves MiniÅ¿ters.

While as you do here take off the Civil power from medling with theÅ¿e Å¿trange and damnable doctrines, and allowes no other means of dealing againÅ¿t them but by the Word and other Å¿pirituall Ordinances, if you do not give a toleration to them, let all men of common Å¿enÅ¿e judge, the PaÅ¿Å¿ages of Scripture hinted at by the Author for putting a colour upon this opinion of his, are miÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably abuÅ¿ed.

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:106774:197"/> not by the power of the creature but by his own power, that, that work was to be carried through, and that therefore they ought not to be diÅ¿couraged, Å¿eeing his power was Å¿ufficient to bear down and remove the greateÅ¿t impediments and to make the weakeÅ¿t means effectuall to accompliÅ¿h the work. 5. It is true that the word and other Ordinances are mighty through God to caÅ¿t down Å¿trong imaginations of vain men, but is it therefore a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ConÅ¿equence, the Word of God and other Ordinances are mighty through God to caÅ¿t down Å¿uch Å¿trong imaginations, as Haereticall Doctrines, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Civil MagiÅ¿trate has nothing to do to Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e the teaching of them by his Sword and power; If Å¿o, then it will as well follow, he has nothing to do to Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e, or puniÅ¿h the out-breakings of carnall luÅ¿ts in adulteries, thefts, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c.

But here 1. It may be juÅ¿t mater of enquiry to others, and haply may be of good purpoÅ¿e to themÅ¿elves to reflect and conÅ¿ider, when theÅ¿e thoughts began firÅ¿t to be born in upon them, at leaÅ¿t when they began to out any thing of them. Did we hear any thing of Å¿uch thoughts in them, but Å¿ince the late great revolution of State in this Kingdom, after <hi>WorceÅ¿ter?</hi> and how Å¿oone thereafter did we hear of them by Å¿ome of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although others thought fit to Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e them Å¿ome longer? This may Å¿eem to be ground of Å¿earching of heart, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:106774:199"/> above meaÅ¿ure. 2. It Å¿eemeth by the Authors own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion, that the bearing in of theÅ¿e thoughts upon them at firÅ¿t has been from no good cauÅ¿e or principle; Not from the Spirit of God, unleÅ¿Å¿e they will Å¿ay, it has been by an immediate impulÅ¿e or EnthuÅ¿iaÅ¿me. For Å¿ay they, it was after a long times Å¿uppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing of them that they began to conÅ¿ult with the Word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, for that is, as I conceive, to bring them to the ballance of the Sanctuary. 3. If implicitely they engaged themÅ¿elves to the maintenance of the Government deÅ¿ined and Å¿ettled in this Church, Å¿ure then if they will reflect upon the nature and tenor of the engagement, they may find themÅ¿elves to have committed, in the very act, more Å¿in, than they inÅ¿inuate here, or I will name. For let them look back again unto the Nationall Covenant, and they Å¿hall find that they not only engaged themÅ¿elves to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Religion profeÅ¿Å¿ed in this Church in all the points thereof: But alÅ¿o declared and proteÅ¿ted themÅ¿elves under Oath, after due Examination of their own conÅ¿ciences in maters of true and falÅ¿e Religion, to be throughly reÅ¿olved of the Truth thereof by the Word and Spirit of God, and therefore to believe with their hearts, confeÅ¿Å¿e with their mouth, and Å¿ubÅ¿cribe with their hands. I do indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ear that many did run unto that Engagement without Å¿uch conviction of mind upon clear warrand of Gods Word found by Examination of the maters. And as to do this with Å¿o Å¿olemne and dreadfull an atteÅ¿tation of God, that they did it upon conviction of conÅ¿cience, was horrible guiltineÅ¿Å¿e: So it may wel be apprehended, that God in his holy judgement, has Å¿uffered many, for the diÅ¿covery of the falÅ¿hood of their hearts (may be in mercy to Å¿ome, may be in wrath to others) to revolt from theÅ¿e their former Engagements. I wiÅ¿h from my heart theÅ¿e Brethren (Å¿o I will yet call them, if they will yet be Å¿o called by us) if it be true which they Å¿ay now, that they engaged implicitely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they proteÅ¿ted before God that they did it upon through convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they would conÅ¿ider this, lay it to heart, and yet againe bring their preÅ¿ent way to the ballance of the Sanctuary. I have been with others witneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿ome who having engaged in the cauÅ¿e of God in theÅ¿e lands, and caried themÅ¿eves therein for a long time reÅ¿olutely and actively, and having afterward foully lapÅ¿ed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:106774:200"/> into contrary courÅ¿es, when they have been brought to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for their backÅ¿liding; Have declared that they found that their back-Å¿liding had ariÅ¿en from this, that their engaging in the cauÅ¿e at firÅ¿t and going on in it formerly, was not upon conviction from grounds of the Word of God, but implicitely and for by and extrinÅ¿ecall reÅ¿pects. 4. It is not competent to me to queÅ¿tion, nor will I queÅ¿tion their diligence in Å¿eeking of God when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enquire about this matter (tho it be a thing uÅ¿uall now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, for men to Å¿et out naughtieÅ¿t wares with this inÅ¿cription <hi>after Å¿eeking of God</hi>) but as for uÅ¿ing of all helps they could have to be cleared, I think Å¿ome thing may be queÅ¿tioned: For beÅ¿ides helps of mens Writings upon this purpoÅ¿e, might they not have uÅ¿ed the help of the advice of the Judicatories of this Kirk and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿ented the grounds of their doubting to Å¿ome of them. Acts of Generall AÅ¿Å¿emblies require this, that before men vent any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in matters of Religion, they Å¿hould firÅ¿t peaceably repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent their ReaÅ¿ons to the publick Judicatures: And albeit, they may haply Å¿ay that the very matters they were queÅ¿tioning was the Authority of theÅ¿e Judicatories; Yet humility, if they had not overweening conceits of their own wits above the judgement of theÅ¿e Judicatures, and charity, if they had Å¿o much as they ought towards the Church, wherein they were born, baptized, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructed, Å¿ome of them had been for Å¿ome years MiniÅ¿ters, and acting in aÅ¿Å¿ociation in the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed Judicatures thereof, might, it Å¿eemeth, led them to Å¿o much. But if they accounted the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures unworthy the conÅ¿ulting with, might they not have uÅ¿ed the help of conference with Å¿ome of theÅ¿e precious and learned men, whom they profeÅ¿Å¿e to reverence? If they did conÅ¿ult with any of them before they were determined in the matter, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did vent their new judgement, is more then I know or can learn. But come we to their determination and the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>

What, does the Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

Is there here a reÅ¿ervation for a further light? It may be we may hear Å¿omewhat of this ere all be done. But go we on to their deÅ¿inition or propoÅ¿ition of the Congregationall way. <hi>To us</hi> (Å¿ay Å¿ay) <hi>it appeareth that ChriÅ¿t hath furniÅ¿hed a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with their ElderÅ¿hip with compleat power of JuriÅ¿diction and cenÅ¿ure within themÅ¿elves.</hi> There are here two things aÅ¿Å¿erted by the Authors which accordingly they intend to prove by their two Arguments <hi>reÅ¿pectivÃ¨,</hi> afterward built upon the paÅ¿Å¿age of Scripture which they cite. 1. That by ChriÅ¿ts appointment the power of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick juriÅ¿diction and cenÅ¿ure is in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<hi>i. e.</hi> the body of privat profeÅ¿Å¿ours) and the ElderÅ¿hip joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (both being to concur formally in the acting thereof) and not only in the ElderÅ¿hip. 2. That any one Å¿ingle Congregation with its ElderÅ¿hip has compleat power of juriÅ¿diction and cenÅ¿ure within it Å¿elf, Å¿upreamly and without Å¿ubordination to any larger or Å¿upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¦</desc>
                     </gap>yterie. But for further clearing of their minde here it were requiÅ¿it they Å¿hould explain theÅ¿e two things to us. 1. Whom they mean by the Congregation contradiÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿hip, whether the whole collection of Church-members, or only men and thoÅ¿e of years of diÅ¿cretion. If the former, then Women and Children muÅ¿t be joint with the ElderÅ¿hip in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of juriÅ¿diction and cenÅ¿ures. If this be their minde we would know it and they would Å¿peak it plainly. If the latter, then it is not the Congregation, but Å¿ome part of the Congregation with the ElderÅ¿hip that has the power of juriÅ¿diction and cenÅ¿ure, or elÅ¿e Women and Children are not parts conÅ¿tituent of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: and then let them tell me where Å¿hall they find the name of the Church, in all the GoÅ¿pel in this notion, taken for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿hip with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ale-profeÅ¿Å¿ours of adult years, excluding Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children? 2. SuppoÅ¿e the whole ElderÅ¿hip of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be Å¿candalous and cenÅ¿urable who has the power of juriÅ¿di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and cenÅ¿ure to exerciÅ¿e toward them? If juriÅ¿diction and cenÅ¿ure Å¿hould be exerciÅ¿ed towards them (as I Å¿uppoÅ¿e it Å¿hould be) who has it, and who muÅ¿t do it? If Å¿ome other EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Court, then Å¿hould not a Å¿ingle Congregation have compleat
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:106774:201"/> power of juriÅ¿diction within it Å¿elf, without Å¿ubordination to any other EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick Court in point of juriÅ¿diction. If the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contradiÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from the ElderÅ¿hip, then the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone by it Å¿elf has power enough of juriÅ¿diction and cenÅ¿ure, and then what needed it be Å¿aid <hi>the Congregation with their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿hip?</hi> And indeed this is the way that Å¿ome Independents goe: In their judgement the Congregation of privat beleevers, does chooÅ¿e, ordain and make their ElderÅ¿hip, and they may, cenÅ¿ure, depoÅ¿e, and Excommunicat all their ElderÅ¿hip. So that theÅ¿e Authors when, intending a deÅ¿cription of the Congregationall way, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Independent way, they attribute the power of juriÅ¿dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and cenÅ¿ure to <hi>the Congregation with their ElderÅ¿hip,</hi> if they mean (as their words Å¿eemeth to import, and they muÅ¿t be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood, unleÅ¿Å¿e they minded to aequivocat) that the power of juriÅ¿diction is given to theÅ¿e jointly, and not to either of them Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, either they have not been acquainted with the mind of all theÅ¿e of the Congregationall way, or they have diÅ¿Å¿embled, the latter of which, I have not reaÅ¿on to impute to all theÅ¿e Authors. The truth is the Authors of the Congregationall way are at a great deal of difference among themÅ¿elves, even to Å¿alt contradictions concerning the Å¿ubject of the power of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick juriÅ¿diction, as Mr. <hi>Caudry</hi> has evidenced in the place cited by us before, <hi>P.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> Go we on to their probation of their AÅ¿Å¿ertion. They cite one paÅ¿Å¿age of Scripture firÅ¿t (telling us withall that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e other Scriptures, which they paÅ¿Å¿e by: But I beleeve it Å¿hal be long ere they let us Å¿ee them) <hi>viz.

If they would aÅ¿Å¿ayed to bring any Arguments to prove that the name of the Church here muÅ¿t be taken, not for the Congregation as contradiÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from, or without Elders, but for the Congregation with the ElderÅ¿hip jointly; I doubt not but we Å¿hould found them all to be Å¿uch, as Å¿peaks power of juriÅ¿di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

What though the word <hi>Church,</hi> be no where elÅ¿e in the New TeÅ¿tament uÅ¿ed for the Elders or Governours of the Church as contradiÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from the body of believers; yet this is but a very weak Argument to prove that it is not Å¿o to be underÅ¿tood here, Å¿o be that the genuine gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Å¿ignification thereof be Å¿uch, as may well be applyed (as indeed the word anÅ¿wering to it in the Hebrew is frequently in the Old TeÅ¿tament applyed) to Å¿ignifie a Colledge or Society of Judges or Governours as contradiÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from the people.

To the AÅ¿Å¿umption or Å¿econd PropoÅ¿ition, it Å¿eemeth theÅ¿e Authors have not well underÅ¿tood, or been acquainted with the Å¿tate and way of Presbyteriall Government Å¿ettled in this Church, and therefore have been too raÅ¿h and haÅ¿tie in condemning it or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing againÅ¿t it, before they underÅ¿tood it. For 1. 'Tis not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falÅ¿e which they Å¿ay, <hi>that the ClaÅ¿Å¿icall PreÅ¿byterie is not the firÅ¿t Judicatorie to which appertaines judiciall cognizance of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, but that firÅ¿t they come to SeÅ¿Å¿ions, &amp;c.</hi> If this be meant UniverÅ¿ally of all offences. Indeed, offences committed by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perÅ¿ons, Å¿ettled members of particular Congregations, and as
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:106774:203"/> yet abiding within the bounds of the Congregation, comes firÅ¿t to the SeÅ¿Å¿ion or ElderÅ¿hip of the particular or Å¿ingle Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But there are many offences the judiciall cognizance whereof comes not firÅ¿t to a SeÅ¿Å¿ion, but to a Presbyterie, yea may be a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, yea may be to the Nationall AÅ¿Å¿embly. When a private perÅ¿on having fallen into Å¿ome Å¿candalous Å¿in, and being conveened before a SeÅ¿Å¿ion, addes refractorineÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t the diÅ¿cipline and obÅ¿tinacie to his former offence, this is a new offence, and the judiciall cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of this offence belongeth firÅ¿t to the ClaÅ¿Å¿icall Presbyterie. So a ClaÅ¿Å¿icall Presbyterie is the firÅ¿t Judicatorie to which belongeth the judiciall cognizance, Of an offence given by a MiniÅ¿ter, in the AdminiÅ¿tration of his calling, Of an offence given by the ElderÅ¿hip of a Congregation (and indeed Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the firÅ¿t part of theÅ¿e Authors AÅ¿Å¿ertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the power of juriÅ¿diction is given to the Congregation with the ElderÅ¿hip jointly, if they grant not an aÅ¿Å¿ociate Presbytery to take judiciall cognizance of their offence, they muÅ¿t exempt them from being Å¿ubject to any judiciall cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance at all: For they cannot come under the judiciall cognizance of another Å¿ingle Congregation) Of an offence wherein more Å¿ingle Congregations are alike concerned, and many caÅ¿es more: I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that theÅ¿e Brethren did not rememher that the firÅ¿t judiciall cognizance, of <hi>James Grahames</hi> offence, of <hi>Seaforts,</hi> and many other publick Malignant wicked practiÅ¿es, was not by SeÅ¿Å¿ions, and from them came by reference to the ClaÅ¿Å¿ical Presbytery, but by the publick AÅ¿Å¿emblies. 2.
